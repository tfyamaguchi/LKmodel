\Abstract{
For a estimation of the infectiveness under the assumption of
mathematical model, either of the \textbf{basic reproduction number}
which is an estimate of the number of secondary infected persons from
one infected patient or the \textbf{secondary infection risk (SIR)} with
exposure of one infected patient in small-scale groups such as household
or school is frequently employed. Longini and Koopman proposed an
infectious disease mathematical model (L-K model) which estimating an
infection risk from distribution of the number of infected patients in
the home within one season. There are two parameters, \(B\) and \(Q\),
which should be estimated in this model, \(1-B\) can be interpreted
medically as the infection probability from a community, and \(1-Q\) as
the household secondary attack rate which is an index of SIR. Although a
previous paper described the estimation method for these parameters in
an epidemiological observation study, the statistical test method for
the clinical trial which compares two intervention groups was not
studied. In order to show the efficacy of the medical agent under
development, it is necessary to plan, carry out and conduct
data-analysis of the clinical trial however, the calculation of the
required number of subjects is impossible without the appropriate test
method. Then, the parameter estimation method was extended, and the test
method for the difference of \(Q\) between 2 groups in this L-K model
was newly developed. The developed tests were derived from the framework
of the statistical test method for the likelihood based-model called a
\textbf{likelihood ratio test}, \textbf{Wald test}, and \textbf{score
test}. The computational procedure was packed. As a result, the
calculation result described in the paper was reproduced. Moreover, the
number of subjects in a clinical trial was estimated from Monte Carlo
simulation using the developed test method, and the reasonable results
were obtained. The developed statistical test method may use in clinical
trials for prevettive agent for household infection.
