abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many of the benefits of soy have been attributed to soy isoflavones.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effects of high- and low-isoflavone soy-protein foods on both lipid and nonlipid risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Forty-one hyperlipidemic men and postmenopausal women participated in a study with three 1-mo diets: a low-fat dairy food control diet and high- (50 g soy protein and 73 mg isoflavones daily) and low- (52 g soy protein and 10 mg isoflavones daily) isoflavone soyfood diets. All 3 diets were very low in saturated fat ({\textless} 5{\%} of energy) and cholesterol ({\textless} 50 mg/d). Fasting blood samples were drawn and blood pressure was measured at the start and end of each diet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No significant differences were seen between the high- and low-isoflavone soy diets. Compared with the control diet, however, both soy diets resulted in significantly lower total cholesterol, estimated CAD risk, and ratios of total to HDL cholesterol, LDL to HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B to A-I. No significant sex differences were observed, except for systolic blood pressure, which in men was significantly lower after the soy diets than after the control diet. On the basis of blood lipid and blood pressure changes, the calculated CAD risk was significantly lower with the soy diets, by 10.1 +/- 2.7{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Substitution of soyfoods for animal products, regardless of isoflavone concentration, reduces the CAD risk because of both modest reductions in blood lipids and reductions in oxidized LDL, homocysteine, and blood pressure.},

abstract = {Worldwide, microalgal biofuel production is being investigated. It is strongly debated which type of production technology is the most adequate. Microalgal biomass production costs were calculated for 3 different micro algal production systems operating at commercial scale today: open ponds, horizontal tubular photobioreactors and flat panel photobioreactors. For the 3 systems, resulting biomass production costs including dewatering, were 4.95, 4.15 and 5.96 € per kg, respectively. The important cost factors are irradiation conditions, mixing, photosynthetic efficiency of systems, medium- and carbon dioxide costs. Optimizing production with respect to these factors, a price of € 0.68 per kg resulted. At this cost level microalgae become a promising feedstock for biodiesel and bulk chemicals. Summary: Photobioreactors may become attractive for microalgal biofuel production. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Polyphenols are abundant micronutrients in our diet, and evidence for their role in the prevention of degenerative diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases is emerging. The health effects of polyphenols depend on the amount consumed and on their bioavailability. In this article, the nature and contents of the various polyphenols present in food sources and the influence of agricultural practices and industrial processes are reviewed. Estimates of dietary intakes are given for each class of polyphenols. The bioavailability of polyphenols is also reviewed, with particular focus on intestinal absorption and the influence of chemical structure (eg, glycosylation, esterification, and polymerization), food matrix, and excretion back into the intestinal lumen. Information on the role of microflora in the catabolism of polyphenols and the production of some active metabolites is presented. Mechanisms of intestinal and hepatic conjugation (methylation, glucuronidation, sulfation), plasma transport, and elimination in bile and urine are also described. Pharmacokinetic data for the various polyphenols are compared. Studies on the identification of circulating metabolites, cellular uptake, intracellular metabolism with possible deconjugation, biological properties of the conjugated metabolites, and specific accumulation in some target tissues are discussed. Finally, bioavailability appears to differ greatly between the various polyphenols, and the most abundant polyphenols in our diet are not necessarily those that have the best bioavailability profile. A thorough knowledge of the bioavailability of the hundreds of dietary polyphenols will help us to identify those that are most likely to exert protective health effects.},

abstract = {The fundamental cause of metabolic syndrome is thought to be abdominal obesity. Accurate diagnosis of abdominal obesity can be done by an x-ray computed tomography (CT) scan. But CT is expensive, bulky and entails the risks involved with radiation. To overcome such disadvantages, we attempted to develop a measuring device that could apply electrical impedance tomography to abdominal fat imaging. The device has 32 electrodes that can be attached to a subject's abdomen by a pneumatic mechanism. That way, electrode position data can be acquired simultaneously. An applied alternating current of 1.0 mArms was used at a frequency of 500 kHz. Sensed voltage data were carefully filtered to remove noise and processed to satisfy the reciprocal theorem. The image reconstruction software was developed concurrently, applying standard finite element methods and the Marquardt method to solve the mathematical inverse problem. The results of preliminary experiments showed that abdominal subcutaneous fat and the muscle surrounding the viscera could be imaged in humans. While our imaging of visceral fat was not of sufficient quality, it was suggested that we will be able to develop a safe and practical abdominal fat scanner through future improvements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously found that obese men have less activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontalcortex (LDLPFC) in response to a meal than do lean men, which indicates an association between this altered neuronal response and the pathophysiology of obesity. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to extend this finding in obese women and to investigate activity in this region in women with a history of severe obesity who have successfully lost weight (ie, formerly obese women, sometimes called postobese women). DESIGN: We reanalyzed previously collected data to compare postmeal (after receiving a liquid meal) with premeal (after a 36-h fast) regional cerebral blood flow, a marker of neuronal activity, by using (15)O-water positron emission tomography in 10 lean [26 +/- 6{\%} body fat (BF)], 9 obese (39 +/- 3{\%}BF) and 8 formerly obese (28 +/- 4{\%}BF) right-handed women. Data were analyzed by using a 2-level, random-effect analysis of variance. RESULTS: The regional cerebral blood flow in the LDLPFC differed in response to the meal across the 3 groups (P {\textless} 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Post hoc group comparisons showed that obese women had significantly less activation in this area than did lean and formerly obese women. No significant difference between formerly obese and lean women was found. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend our previous findings, indicating that obese women have less activation in the LDLPFC in response to a meal than do lean or formerly obese women. Neuronal activity in this region did not differ significantly between the latter 2 groups. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these differences in neuronal activity change with or predict weight change.},

abstract = {Hemoglobin adducts have been used as biomarkers of exposure to reactive chemicals. Glycidol, an animal carcinogen, has been reported to form N-(2,3-dihydroxy-propyl)valine adducts to hemoglobin (diHOPrVal). To support the use of these adducts as markers of glycidol exposure, we investigated the kinetics of diHOPrVal formation and its elimination in vitro and in vivo.Five groups of rats were orally administered a single dose of glycidol ranging from 0 to 75mg/kg bw, and diHOPrVal levels were measured 24h after administration. A dose-dependent increase in diHOPrVal levels was observed with high linearity (R2=0.943). Blood sampling at different time points (1, 10, 20, or 40days) from four groups administered glycidol at 12mg/kg bw suggested a linear decrease in diHOPrVal levels compatible with the normal turnover of rat erythrocytes (life span, 61days), with the calculated first-order elimination rate constant (kel) indicating that the diHOPrVal adduct was chemically stable.Then, we measured the second-order rate constant (kval) for the reaction of glycidol with N-terminal valine in rat and human hemoglobin in in vitro experiments with whole blood. The kval was 6.7. ±. 1.1 and 5.6. ±. 1.3 (pmol/g globin per $\mu$Mh) in rat and human blood, respectively, indicating no species differences. In vivo doses estimated from kval and diHOPrVal levels were in agreement with the area under the (concentration-time) curve values determined in our earlier toxicokinetic study in rats.Our results indicate that diHOPrVal is a useful biomarker for quantification of glycidol exposure and for risk assessment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) is useful in assessing acute changes in contractile state. However, a limitation of ESPVR is that its slope decreases progressively as ventricular size increases without this change necessarily indicating a change in contractile state. In this respect, an index of contractile function that is independent of ventricular size would have an obvious advantage. The exponential constant (k) of the end-systolic relation between wall stress (sigma) and the natural logarithm of the reciprocal of wall thickness [ln(1/H)], sigma = Cekln(1/H), corresponds to the stiffness constant of the myocardium (kSM), a contractile index that should be independent of ventricular size and geometry. To examine the size independence of kSM, we studied left ventricular kSM during beta-blockade (to stabilize inotropic state) in 25 normal dogs with greatly differing ventricular sizes whose end-diastolic volumes ranged from 14 to 82 ml. The kSM was nearly constant (3.6 +/- 0.4) over this wide range of end-diastolic volumes and thus was independent of end-diastolic volume. Conversely, ESPVR, also obtained during beta-blockade, was closely and negatively correlated to end-diastolic volume (r = 0.92). To test the ability of kSM to measure changes in contractile state, we altered contractile state pharmacologically. The kSM increased from 3.7 +/- 0.5 to 4.8 +/- 0.8 (p less than 0.01) with infusion of dobutamine (after reversal of beta-blockade) and decreased to 3.1 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.05) with inhalation of isoflurane, a negative inotrope, during beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). We conclude that kSM is independent of ventricular size and is sensitive to changes in inotropic state. As such, it should be useful as an index of contractile function.},

abstract = {Fat mass is a predictor of BMD; however, the mechanisms involved remain uncertain. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, were examined as potential mediators of this relation in 80 perimenopausal women. Adiponectin did not exert any effect on BMD, whereas leptin exerted a negative one, with insulin acting as a confounder to this relation. INTRODUCTION: Fat mass is an important determinant of bone density, but the mechanism involved in this relation is uncertain. Leptin and adiponectin, as circulating peptides of adipocyte origin, are potential contributors to this relation. We investigated the role of leptin and adiponectin in mediating fat mass effects on the skeleton of perimenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five premenopausal and 55 postmenopausal, healthy women (42-68 years old) participated in our study. Lumbar spine BMD (BMD(L2-L4)) and total body BMC (TBBMC) were measured with DXA, leptin levels with ELISA, and adiponectin levels with radioimmunoassay (RIA). Additionally, body composition analysis was performed, as well as measurements of several hormones. RESULTS: It was shown that serum leptin levels were negatively correlated with BMD (beta = -0.005, p = 0.027) and TBBMC (beta = -14.32, p = 0.013). The above correlation was observed only when serum insulin levels were included, as an independent variable, in the regression analysis model. Adiponectin was not significantly correlated with BMD(L2-L4) nor with TBBMC, either in the presence or absence of insulin. CONCLUSION: Circulating adiponectin does not seem to exert any effect on bone mass. In contrast, circulating leptin showed a negative correlation with bone mass, dependent on serum insulin levels.},

abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. The probability that a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. In this paper we address this very large multi-plicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based FDR con-trolling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the nave application of the linear step-up procedure in Ben-jamini and Hochberg (1995). The procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation. Results: Comparative simulation analysis shows that all four FDR controlling procedures control the FDR at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. In terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the nave one. The highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of FDR control. Availability: An R program that adjusts p-values using FDR controlling procedures is freely available over the Internet at www.math.tau.ac.il/∼ybenja.},

abstract = {To elucidate the function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in taste encoding, it is worth applying to taste, the psychological paradigms of intentional memorization that have been used with other extensively studied senses, and thus updating current models for LPFC functions to include a taste modality. Using multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we examined the LPFC's of healthy volunteers (N??=??18) during the intentional memorization of a basic taste. In order to minimize the confounding effects of verbal processes that are known to employ the left LPFC, we used quaternary taste mixtures that were difficult to verbalize, and confined analysis to those who did not use a verbal strategy during memorization (N??=??10). In order to examine the results in association with data in the literature, the location of activity was probabilistically estimated and anatomically labeled in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard brain space. By contrasting the cortical activation under encoding conditions with that under control conditions without memory requirement, we found activation in the bilateral ventro-LPFC and the right posterior portion of the LPFC. The activation pattern was consistent with previous studies on the encoding of nonverbal materials using other senses. This suggests that models for LPFC functions that derive from previous studies can be generalized to intentional encoding processes of taste information, at least at a macro-structural level. The current study also demonstrates that, by using fNIRS, LPFC functions on taste can be examined with experimental paradigms relevant to those used for other senses. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that early intervention of vitamin A-enriched diet contains the development of obesity and improves insulin resistance, 50-day-old male lean and obese rats of WNIN/Ob strain were given either stock diet (2.6 mg vitamin A/kg diet) or vitamin A-enriched diet (129 mg vitamin A/kg diet) for 3 months. Compared with stock diet-fed obese rats, vitamin A-enriched diet-fed obese rats had reduced body weight gain, visceral adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity as evidenced by decreased fasting plasma insulin and unaltered glucose levels, which could possibly be due to higher phosphorylation of soleus muscle insulin receptor. This in turn is explained by decreased protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) levels. Most of these changes were not observed in lean rats. In conclusion, chronic feeding of vitamin A-enriched diet to obese rats at an early age ameliorates visceral adiposity and improves the insulin sensitivity, possibly by decreasing soleus muscle PTP1B levels.},

abstract = {This study was aimed to examine the cross-sectional association of protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake with depressive symptoms among 1794 Japanese male workers aged 18-69 years who participated in a health survey. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Odds ratio of depressive symptoms (CES-D scale of ≥16) was estimated by using multiple logistic regression with adjustment for covariates including folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, polyunsaturated fatty acid, magnesium, and iron intake. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of depressive symptoms for the highest quartile of protein intake was 26{\%}, albeit not statistically significant, lower compared with the lowest. The inverse association was more evident when a cutoff value of CES-D score ≥19 was used. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) for the highest through lowest quartile of protein intake were 1.00 (reference), 0.69 (0.47-1.01), 0.69 (0.44-1.09), and 0.58 (0.31-1.06) (P for trend=0.096). Neither carbohydrate nor fat intake was associated with depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that low protein intake may be associated with higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japanese male workers.},

abstract = {Backbround and Objectives: Development of a new method of analysis to evaluate the acceptability of (or preferences for) the treatments in a randomized trial, and the benefit of treatment among compliers. Materials and Methods: We characterize trial participants through the groups who would: accept either treatment if offered (compliers); refuse one treatment but accept the other if it is offered to them (two groups of preferers); or prefer one treatment and insist on it if it is not offered to them initially (two groups of insisters). Results: We show that in our framework, one can always estimate the proportions of patients in these five preference groups. However, constraints are required to estimate the corresponding outcome rates, and thus estimate the treatment effect in the compliers. We propose two possible sets of constraints and illustrate them by numerical examples. Conclusions: The traditional intention-to-treat analysis avoids biases associated with the alternative per-protocol or as-treated approaches, but it provides imperfect information about the expected treatment effect among patients who are committed to taking the treatment. Many physicians and patients want to know the expected benefit if they adhere to the therapy. Our preference-based analysis provides an estimate of treatment benefit among such patients. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Assessing the performance of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems usually requires a phantom for validation, calibration, or comparison purposes. This paper describes a resistive mesh phantom to assess the performance of EIT systems while taking into account cabling stray effects similar to in vivo conditions. This phantom is built with 340 precision resistors on a printed circuit board representing a 2-D circular homogeneous medium. It also integrates equivalent electrical models of the Ag/AgCl electrode impedances. The parameters of the electrode models were fitted from impedance curves measured with an impedance analyzer. The technique used to build the phantom is general and applicable to phantoms of arbitrary shape and conductivity distribution. We describe three performance indicators that can be measured with our phantom for every measurement of an EIT data frame: SNR, accuracy, and modeling accuracy. These performance indicators were evaluated on our EIT system under different frame rates and applied current intensities. The performance indicators are dependent on frame rate, operating frequency, applied current intensity, measurement strategy, and intermodulation distortion when performing simultaneous measurements at several frequencies. These parameter values should, therefore, always be specified when reporting performance indicators to better appreciate their significance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To examine an association between self-reported sleep quality determined by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and metabolic syndrome. METHODS: This study was designed as cross-sectional study. Participants were 1481 adults aged 20 years and above from general population (549 males and 932 females). We assessed the global sleep quality by PSQI. PSQI consists of 7 elements, i.e. subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (prolonged sleep onset time), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency (proportion of hours slept to hours spent in bed), sleep disturbance (interruption of sleep), use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction (trouble staying awake while engaging in social activity). Any participants with score of 6 or more are diagnosed to have sleep disorder. We also assessed the above 7 elements, which consisted of a four-grade system (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3). Metabolic syndrome consisted of abdominal obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was done when the participants have abdominal obesity and meet two or more other components. All analyses were adjusted by age, drinking habit, smoking habit, working hours, exercise habit and depression. RESULTS: Fifty-two male participants (9.5{\%}) and 133 female (14.3{\%}) scored 6 or more points in global PSQI score. The global PSQI score, sleep latency score and sleep disturbance score of participants with metabolic syndrome were higher level than those without the condition (p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.009, p = 0.025 for male and p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.002 for females, respectively). The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome among participants with PSQI score of 6 or more points were 2.37 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.23-4.58) for males and 2.71 (1.45-5.07) for females in contrast to those with 5 or less points. The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome with sleep latency score of 2 was 2.65 (1.14-6.15) for male and 3.82 (1.81-8.09) for females in contrast with those of 0. The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome with sleep disturbance score of 1 was 1.76 (1.09-2.86) for males and 2.43 (1.26-4.69) for females in contrast with those of 0. CONCLUSIONS: Global PSQI score and its components (especially, sleep latency and sleep disturbance) were associated with metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Here we report a unique cellular reprogramming phenomenon, called stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP), which requires neither nuclear transfer nor the introduction of transcription factors. In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells. Through real-time imaging of STAP cells derived from purified lymphocytes, as well as gene rearrangement analysis, we found that committed somatic cells give rise to STAP cells by reprogramming rather than selection. STAP cells showed a substantial decrease in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of pluripotency marker genes. Blastocyst injection showed that STAP cells efficiently contribute to chimaeric embryos and to offspring via germline transmission. We also demonstrate the derivation of robustly expandable pluripotent cell lines from STAP cells. Thus, our findings indicate that epigenetic fate determination of mammalian cells can be markedly converted in a context-dependent manner by strong environmental cues.},

Objective Examine the association between physiologic testosterone levels with lean and fat mass. Methods Data from the 1999–2000 NHANES were used (n = 252 men; 18–85 yrs). Testosterone and SHBG values were obtained by a morning blood sample. Body composition was measured by DXA. Multivariable linear regression was used to compute unadjusted, minimally adjusted, and extended models of relative upper- and lower-body lean and fat mass. Results In the extended model, men with total testosterone levels in the highest 25{\%} (4th quartile) had more lower-body lean mass (LBLM) ($\beta$ = 22.1({\%}), 95{\%}CI: 9.0, 35.3, p = 0.003) and upper-body lean mass (UBLM) ($\beta$ = 5.6({\%}), 95{\%}CI: 0.1, 11.2, p = 0.046), and less lower-body fat mass (LBFM) ($\beta$ = −9.9({\%}), 95{\%}CI: -17.7, −2.1, p = 0.016) and upper-body fat mass (UBFM) ($\beta$ = −6.1({\%}), 95{\%}CI: −10.1, −2.1, p = 0.005) than those in the 1st quartile.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Observational studies report that influenza vaccination reduces winter mortality risk from any cause by 50{\%} among the elderly. Influenza vaccination coverage among elderly persons ({\textgreater} or =65 years) in the United States increased from between 15{\%} and 20{\%} before 1980 to 65{\%} in 2001. Unexpectedly, estimates of influenza-related mortality in this age group also increased during this period. We tried to reconcile these conflicting findings by adjusting excess mortality estimates for aging and increased circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses. METHODS We used a cyclical regression model to generate seasonal estimates of national influenza-related mortality (excess mortality) among the elderly in both pneumonia and influenza and all-cause deaths for the 33 seasons from 1968 to 2001. We stratified the data by 5-year age group and separated seasons dominated by A(H3N2) viruses from other seasons. RESULTS For people aged 65 to 74 years, excess mortality rates in A(H3N2)-dominated seasons fell between 1968 and the early 1980s but remained approximately constant thereafter. For persons 85 years or older, the mortality rate remained flat throughout. Excess mortality in A(H1N1) and B seasons did not change. All-cause excess mortality for persons 65 years or older never exceeded 10{\%} of all winter deaths. CONCLUSIONS We attribute the decline in influenza-related mortality among people aged 65 to 74 years in the decade after the 1968 pandemic to the acquisition of immunity to the emerging A(H3N2) virus. We could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group. Because fewer than 10{\%} of all winter deaths were attributable to influenza in any season, we conclude that observational studies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit.},

abstract = {Body weight is known to be associated with bone mass, however, it is unclear whether body composition, as reflected by the percent of total weight that is fat tissue ({\%}fat), is associated with bone mass independently of weight. Fat tissue is metabolically active, and hormonal factors may mediate an association of {\%}fat with bone mass. Leptin, a hormone produced in fat tissue, has recently been shown to be inversely related to bone mass in mice, but whether it is related to human bone mass is uncertain. We sought to investigate the associations of {\%}fat and of serum leptin concentration with bone mineral density (BMD) in a cohort of 153 premenopausal women. BMD measurements of the total hip, lumbar spine and total body as well as body composition were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Serum leptin levels were established using a commercial competitive binding assay. Individually, body weight, {\%}fat and leptin were each positively associated with BMD at all three sites. However, when we examined BMD either as a function of both body weight and {\%}fat together, or as a function of both body weight and leptin together, we found that for a given body weight, BMD appeared to be inversely associated with {\%}fat and similarly appeared to be inversely associated with leptin. When BMD was examined as a function of {\%}fat and leptin together, we found that for a given {\%}fat, leptin appeared to be inversely associated with BMD. In summary, the results of this study suggest that for a given body weight, a higher proportion of fat and a higher serum leptin concentration have negative associations with bone mass in premenopausal women.},

abstract = {The influence of hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ) on the antihypertensive effects of chlorogenic acids in coffee was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of high-normotensive and mild hypertensive adult men and women. The subjects were randomly assigned to either an active group that ingested HHQ-reduced coffee (0.05mg/184 ml) containing chlorogenic acids (299 mg/184 ml) or a control group that ingested coffee containing HHQ (1.69 mg/184 ml) and chlorogenic acids (299 mg/184 ml), corresponding to commercially available products. Each subject was instructed to continuously ingest one can of test beverage (coffee) daily for 12 weeks. A linear mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of covariance of 38 high-normotensives and 60 mild hypertensives showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly lower in the active group (n = 51) than in the control group (n = 47) throughout the intake period (Group effect; p = 0.031). A stratified analysis suggested that the antihypertensive effect was greater in the mild hypertensives (Group effect; p = 0.013 in SBP and p = 0.015 in diastolic blood pressure) than in the high-normotensives. Safety assessment revealed no adverse effects associated with the reduction of HHQ to a level lower than the amounts in commercially available coffee products. These results suggest that HHQ-reduced coffee containing chlorogenic acids can be safely ingested to improve hypertension},

abstract = {Increased hunger and food intake during attempts to maintain weight loss are a critical problem in clinical management of obesity. To determine whether reduced body weight maintenance is accompanied by leptin-sensitive changes in neural activity in brain regions affecting regulatory and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, we examined brain region-specific neural activity elicited by food-related visual cues using functional MRI in 6 inpatient obese subjects. Subjects were assessed at their usual weight and, following stabilization at a 10{\%} reduced body weight, while receiving either twice daily subcutaneous injections of leptin or placebo. Following weight loss, there were predictable changes in neural activity, many of which were reversed by leptin, in brain areas known to be involved in the regulatory, emotional, and cognitive control of food intake. Specifically, following weight loss there were leptin-reversible increases in neural activity in response to visual food cues in the brainstem, culmen, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior and middle frontal gyri, middle temporal gyrus, and lingual gyrus. There were also leptin-reversible decreases in activity in response to food cues in the hypothalamus, cingulate gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus. These data are consistent with a model of the weight-reduced state as one of relative leptin deficiency.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and the incidence of diabetes among initially healthy participants. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with estimates of relative risk adjusted for sex, age, years of university education, total energy intake, body mass index, physical activity, sedentary habits, smoking, family history of diabetes, and personal history of hypertension. SETTING: Spanish university department. PARTICIPANTS: 13 380 Spanish university graduates without diabetes at baseline followed up for a median of 4.4 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary habits assessed at baseline with a validated 136 item food frequency questionnaire and scored on a nine point index. New cases of diabetes confirmed through medical reports and an additional detailed questionnaire posted to those who self reported a new diagnosis of diabetes by a doctor during follow-up. Confirmed cases of type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Participants who adhered closely to a Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of diabetes. The incidence rate ratios adjusted for sex and age were 0.41 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.19 to 0.87) for those with moderate adherence (score 3-6) and 0.17 (0.04 to 0.75) for those with the highest adherence (score 7-9) compared with those with low adherence (score {\textless}3). In the fully adjusted analyses the results were similar. A two point increase in the score was associated with a 35{\%} relative reduction in the risk of diabetes (incidence rate ratio 0.65, 0.44 to 0.95), with a significant inverse linear trend (P=0.04) in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes.},

A brief overview of biological injury processes that impinge on the aging brain is provided, and their overall effect on the integrity of neural architecture is described. Cognitive decline associated with aging, and white matter connectivity degradation as a biological substrate for that decline, is then described. We then briefly describe the technology of DTI as a means for in vivo, non-invasive interrogation of white matter connectivity, and relate it to FLAIR, a more traditional MRI method for assessing white matter injury. We then survey the existing findings on relationships between aging-associated neuropathological processes and DTI measurements on one hand; and relationships between DTI measurements and late-life cognitive function on the other. We conclude with a summary of current research directions in relation to DTI studies of cognitive aging.},

abstract = {Leptin, the product of the obese gene, is a circulating hormone secreted primarily from adipocytes. The lack of leptin in ob/ob mice, who are homozygous for the obese gene, results in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, obesity, infertility, decreased brain size and decreased stature. To this end, we investigated the role of leptin as a hormonal regulator of bone growth. Leptin administration led to a significant increase in femoral length, total body bone area, bone mineral content and bone density in ob/ob mice as compared to vehicle treated controls. The increase in total body bone mass was a result of an increase in both trabecular and cortical bone mass. These results suggest that the decreased stature of the ob/ob mouse is due to a developmental defect that is readily reversible upon leptin administration. Our demonstration that the signalling or long form (Ob-Rb) of the leptin receptor is present in both primary adult osteoblasts and chondrocytes suggests that the growth promoting effects of leptin could be direct. In summary, these results indicate a novel role for leptin in skeletal bone growth and development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We aimed to investigate efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of NPI in households with influenza index patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial during the pandemic season 2009/10 and the ensuing influenza season 2010/11. We included households with an influenza positive index case in the absence of further respiratory illness within the preceding 14 days. Study arms were wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group). Main outcome measure was laboratory confirmed influenza infection in a household contact. We used daily questionnaires to examine adherence and tolerability of the interventions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We recruited 84 households (30 control, 26 M and 28 MH households) with 82, 69 and 67 household contacts, respectively. In 2009/10 all 41 index cases had a influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection, in 2010/11 24 had an A (H1N1) pdm09 and 20 had a B infection. The total secondary attack rate was 16{\%} (35/218). In intention-to-treat analysis there was no statistically significant effect of the M and MH interventions on secondary infections. When analysing only households where intervention was implemented within 36 h after symptom onset of the index case, secondary infection in the pooled M and MH groups was significantly lower compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.16, 95{\%} CI, 0.03-0.92). In a per-protocol analysis odds ratios were significantly reduced among participants of the M group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30, 95{\%} CI, 0.10-0.94). With the exception of MH index cases in 2010/11 adherence was good for adults and children, contacts and index cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently. Concerns about acceptability and tolerability of the interventions should not be a reason against their recommendation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT00833885).},

abstract = {Obesity is traditionally viewed to be beneficial to bone health because of well-established positive effect of mechanical loading conferred by body weight on bone formation, despite being a risk factor for many other chronic health disorders. Although body mass has a positive effect on bone formation, whether the mass derived from an obesity condition or excessive fat accumulation is beneficial to bone remains controversial. The underline pathophysiological relationship between obesity and bone is complex and continues to be an active research area. Recent data from epidemiological and animal studies strongly support that fat accumulation is detrimental to bone mass. To our knowledge, obesity possibly affects bone metabolism through several mechanisms. Because both adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from a common multipotential mesenchymal stem cell, obesity may increase adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation while decrease osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation. The increased circulating and tissue proinflammatory cytokines in obesity may promote osteoclast activity and bone resorption through modifying the receptor activator of NF-$\kappa$B (RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin pathway. Furthermore, the excessive secretion of leptin and/or decreased production of adiponectin by adipocytes in obesity may either directly affect bone formation or indirectly affect bone resorption through up-regulated proinflammatory cytokine production. Finally, high-fat intake may interfere with intestinal calcium absorption and therefore decrease calcium availability for bone formation. Unraveling the relationship between fat and bone metabolism at molecular level may help us to develop therapeutic agents to prevent or treat both obesity and osteoporosis. Obesity, defined as having a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2, is a condition in which excessive body fat accumulates to a degree that adversely affects health. The rates of obesity rates have doubled since 1980 and as of 2007, 33{\%} of men and 35{\%} of women in the US are obese. Obesity is positively associated to many chronic disorders such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers. It is estimated that the direct medical cost associated with obesity in the United States is {\~{}}{\$}100 billion per year.Bone mass and strength decrease during adulthood, especially in women after menopause. These changes can culminate in osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration resulting in increased bone fracture risk. It is estimated that there are about 10 million Americans over the age of 50 who have osteoporosis while another 34 million people are at risk of developing the disease. In 2001, osteoporosis alone accounted for some {\$}17 billion in direct annual healthcare expenditure. Several lines of evidence suggest that obesity and bone metabolism are interrelated. First, both osteoblasts (bone forming cells) and adipocytes (energy storing cells) are derived from a common mesenchymal stem cell and agents inhibiting adipogenesis stimulated osteoblast differentiation and vice versa, those inhibiting osteoblastogenesis increased adipogenesis. Second, decreased bone marrow osteoblastogenesis with aging is usually accompanied with increased marrow adipogenesis. Third, chronic use of steroid hormone, such as glucocorticoid, results in obesity accompanied by rapid bone loss. Fourth, both obesity and osteoporosis are associated with elevated oxidative stress and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. At present, the mechanisms for the effects of obesity on bone metabolism are not well defined and will be the focus of this review.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the ability to produce equol, a metabolite of the soya isoflavone daidzein, is beneficial to coronary health. Equol, generated by bacterial action on isoflavones in the human gut, is biologically more potent than dietary sources of isoflavones. Not all humans are equol producers. We investigated whether equol-producing status is favourably associated with risk factors for CHD following an intervention by dietary soya isoflavones. We systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCT) that evaluated the effect of soya isoflavones on risk factors for CHD and that reported equol-producing status. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid Medline and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials published up to April 2015 and hand-searched bibliographies to identify the RCT. Characteristics of participants and outcomes measurements were extracted and qualitatively analysed. From a total of 1671 studies, we identified forty-two articles that satisfied our search criteria. The effects of equol on risk factors for CHD were mainly based on secondary analyses in these studies, thus with inadequate statistical power. Although fourteen out of the forty-two studies found that equol production after a soya isoflavone intervention significantly improved a range of risk factors including cholesterol and other lipids, inflammation and blood pressure variables, these results need further verification by sufficiently powered studies. The other twenty-eight studies primarily reported null results. RCT of equol, which has recently become available as a dietary supplement, on CHD and its risk factors are awaited.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Increased protein proportions in the diet combined with energy restriction has been shown to enhance weight loss during dietary intervention. It is not known if the beneficial effect of dietary protein exists in the general population under normal living conditions without a negative energy balance. METHODS A total of 1834 participants (n = 443 men, n = 1391 women) were recruited from the CODING study. Participants' dietary macronutrient compositions were determined through a Willett FFQ. Body composition variables including percent body fat ({\%}BF), percent trunk fat ({\%}TF), percent total lean mass ({\%}LM), and percent trunk lean mass ({\%}TLM) were determined using DXA. Major confounding factors including age, physical activity levels, total caloric intake, carbohydrate intake, menopausal status, smoking status and medication use were controlled for in all analyses. RESULTS Significant inverse relationships were observed between dietary protein intake (g/kg body weight/day) and weight, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, {\%}BF, and {\%}TF (P {\textless} 0.001). Significant positive relationships were observed with {\%}LM and {\%}TLM (P {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, significant differences in weight (12.7 kg in men, 11.4 kg in women), BMI (4.1 BMI units in men, 4.2 units in women), and {\%}BF (7.6{\%} in men, 6.0{\%} in women) were observed between low and high dietary protein consuming groups (P {\textless} 0.001). Dietary protein explained 11{\%} of the total variation in {\%}BF in the NL population. CONCLUSION This study provides strong evidence that higher protein intake, even in the absence of energy restriction, is associated with a more favorable body composition in the general population.},

abstract = {The Longini-Koopman model (1982, Biometrics 38, 115-126) describes the process underlying the transmission of an infectious disease in terms of household and community level transmission probabilities. This model is generalized by allowing for different transmission probabilities that may correspond to various levels of risk factors on both the household and community levels. Two types of models are considered: (i) models for household data, where the numbers of susceptible and infected members in each household are known along with the values of household level risk factors; and (ii) models for individual data, where the infection status and risk factor level are known for each individual in the household. Although the type (i) models can be expressed as special cases of the type (ii) models, they deserve special attention as they can be represented and analyzed as log-linear models. Both types of models can be analyzed using maximum likelihood methods, while the type (i) models, when expressed as log-linear models, can also be analyzed by the weighted least squares method. Data from influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan and Seattle, Washington are used to illustrate these methods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Eating behavior in humans is influenced by variables other than just hunger-satiety including cognitive restraint, emotional distress, and sensitivity to food stimuli. We investigate the role of dopamine (DA), a neurotransmitter involved with food motivation, in these variables. METHODS: We used the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) to measure Restraint, Emotionality, and Externality in 10 subjects. We correlated DEBQ scores with brain DA levels. Positron emission tomography and [(11)C]raclopride uptake were used to measure baseline D(2) receptors (neutral stimulation) and to assess changes in extracellular DA to food stimulation (display of food). RESULTS: Restraint was correlated with DA changes with food stimulation (higher restraint, greater responsivity), emotionality was negatively correlated with baseline D(2) receptors (higher emotionality, lower D(2) receptors), whereas externality was not. These correlations were significant in the dorsal but not in the ventral striatum. DISCUSSION: These results provide evidence that DA in the dorsal striatum is involved with the restraint and emotionality components regulating eating behavior and that these two dimensions reflect different neurobiologic processes.},

abstract = {It is well known in the literature that the problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks is very hard to tackle: its computational complexity is super-exponential in the number of nodes in the worst case and polynomial in most real-world scenarios. Efficient implementations of score-based structure learning benefit from past and current research in optimisation theory, which can be adapted to the task by using the network score as the objective function to maximise. This is not true for approaches based on conditional independence tests, called constraint-based learning algorithms. The only optimisation in widespread use, backtracking, leverages the symmetries implied by the definitions of neighbourhood and Markov blanket. In this paper we illustrate how backtracking is implemented in recent versions of the bnlearn R package, and how it degrades the stability of Bayesian network structure learning for little gain in terms of speed. As an alternative, we describe a software architecture and framework that can be used to parallelise constraint-based structure learning algorithms (also implemented in bnlearn) and we demonstrate its performance using four reference networks and two real-world data sets from genetics and systems biology. We show that on modern multi-core or multiprocessor hardware parallel implementations are preferable over backtracking, which was developed when single-processor machines were the norm.},

abstract = {Gonadal failure induces bone loss while obesity prevents it. This raises the possibility that bone mass, body weight, and gonadal function are regulated by common pathways. To test this hypothesis, we studied leptin-deficient and leptin receptor-deficient mice that are obese and hypogonadic. Both mutant mice have an increased bone formation leading to high bone mass despite hypogonadism and hypercortisolism. This phenotype is dominant, independent of the presence of fat, and specific for the absence of leptin signaling. There is no leptin signaling in osteoblasts but intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin causes bone loss in leptin-deficient and wild-type mice. This study identifies leptin as a potent inhibitor of bone formation acting through the central nervous system and therefore describes the central nature of bone mass control and its disorders.},

abstract = {High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a new in vivo imaging technique for assessing 3D microstructure of cortical and trabecular bone at the distal radius and tibia. No studies have investigated the extent to which measurements of the peripheral skeleton by HR-pQCT reflect those of the spine and hip, where the most serious fractures occur. To address this research question, we performed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), central QCT (cQCT), HR-pQCT, and image-based finite-element analyses on 69 premenopausal women to evaluate relationships among cortical and trabecular bone density, geometry, microstructure, and stiffness of the lumbar spine, proximal femur, distal radius, and distal tibia. Significant correlations were found between the stiffness of the two peripheral sites (r = 0.86), two central sites (r = 0.49), and between the peripheral and central skeletal sites (r = 0.56-0.70). These associations were explained in part by significant correlations in areal bone mineral density (aBMD), volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), and cross-sectional area (CSA) between the multiple skeletal sites. For the prediction of proximal femoral stiffness, vBMD (r = 0.75) and stiffness (r = 0.69) of the distal tibia by HR-pQCT were comparable with direct measurements of the proximal femur: aBMD of the hip by DXA (r = 0.70) and vBMD of the hip by cQCT (r = 0.64). For the prediction of vertebral stiffness, trabecular vBMD (r = 0.58) and stiffness (r = 0.70) of distal radius by HR-pQCT were comparable with direct measurements of lumbar spine: aBMD by DXA (r = 0.78) and vBMD by cQCT (r = 0.67). Our results suggest that bone density and microstructural and mechanical properties measured by HR-pQCT of the distal radius and tibia reflect the mechanical competence of the central skeleton.},

Stuttering speakers (n = 12) and non-stuttering controls (n = 12) were scanned while performing a picture-naming task and a passive-viewing (baseline) task. Results showed significant differences between stuttering and non-stuttering speakers in both effective connectivity and anatomical structures in the BGTC in the left brain. Specifically, compared to non-stuttering speakers, stuttering speakers showed weaker negative connectivity from the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (PMTG) to the putamen, but stronger positive connectivity from the putamen to the thalamus, from the thalamus to the PMTG and anterior supplementary motor area (preSMA), and from the anterior superior temporal gyrus (ASTG) to the preSMA. Accompanying such altered connectivity were anatomical differences: compared to non-stuttering controls, stuttering speakers showed more grey matter (GM) volume concentration in the left putamen, less GM volume concentration in the left medial frontal gyrus and ASTG, and less white matter volume concentration underlying the left posterior superior temporal gyrus inside the BGTC. These results shed significant light on the neural mechanisms (in terms of both functional connectivity and neural anatomy) of stuttering. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Increased physical activity is associated with successful long-term weight loss maintenance due to mechanisms likely more complex than simply increased energy expenditure. The impact of physical activity on the central regulation of food intake may be an important mechanism of this effect. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of exercise training and acute exercise on the neuronal response to food cues as well as eating behaviors. fMRI was performed in the fasted state at baseline and again after a 6 month progressive exercise intervention (supervised, 5 days/wk) both with and without an acute exercise bout in 12 overweight/obese (5 women, 7 men; BMI 33 ± 4 kg/m(2)) healthy adults. fMRI data were acquired while subjects were presented with visual stimuli of foods of high hedonic value as compared to neutral control objects. Questionnaires on eating behaviors, ratings of appeal and desire for foods, and ratings of appetite (hunger, satiety, prospective intake) using visual analog scales were also performed at baseline and again after the 6-month exercise intervention. While only a trend was observed for a reduction in body weight (102 ± 5 to 99 ± 6 kg, p=0.09), a significant reduction in fat mass was observed (36.4 ± 2.8 to 33.7 ± 3.2 kg, p=0.04), although as expected changes in fat mass were variable (-10.0 to +3.7 kg). Chronic exercise was associated with a reduction in the neuronal response to food, primarily in the posterior attention network and insula. A significant positive correlation between the change in fat/body mass and the change in insula response to food cues with chronic exercise was observed. An acute exercise bout attenuated the effects of chronic exercise. The exercise intervention, however, did not impact any of the measures of appetitive behavior. In summary, despite no effects on behavioral measures of appetite, chronic exercise training was associated with attenuation in the response to visual food cues in brain regions known to be important in food intake regulation. The insula, in particular, appears to play an important role in the potential exercise-induced weight loss and weight loss maintenance.},

abstract = {AIM To investigate the clinical and biochemical factors associated with visceral fat accumulation in the general population. METHODS We enrolled 1004 subjects who underwent a medical health checkup between April 2008 and March 2009. The medical health checkup included the following tests: Height, body weight, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, urinalysis, blood-cell counts, blood chemistry, electrocardiography, chest radiography, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) for visceral fat accumulation. The patients' medical history and lifestyle factors were collected privately by nurses using a self-administered questionnaire, and they included questions regarding physical activity, sleep duration, dietary habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Visceral fat area (VFA) was defined as the sum of the intraperitoneal fat area at the level of the umbilicus with CT density in the range of -150 to -50 Hounsfield units. RESULTS The mean age and body mass index (BMI) of the study subjects were 57.0 years and 24.4 kg/m(2). In both male and females, VFA was significantly and positively correlated with WC (r = 0.532, P {\textless} 0.01; r = 0.612, P {\textless} 0.01). Subjects with high levels of VFA were primarily male with significantly higher age, height, body weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, and hemoglobin in all subjects (P {\textless} 0.05). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that VFA had a positive relationship with age ≥ 56, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2), and triglyceride level ≥ 149 in males (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas it had a positive relationship with age ≥ 58, BMI ≥ 24.4 kg/m(2), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level {\textless} 40 mg/dL, and current drinking in females (P {\textless} 0.05).

The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication.},

abstract = {The "metabolic syndrome" (MetS) is a clustering of components that reflect overnutrition, sedentary lifestyles, and resultant excess adiposity. The MetS includes the clustering of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure and is associated with other comorbidities including the prothrombotic state, proinflammatory state, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and reproductive disorders. Because the MetS is a cluster of different conditions, and not a single disease, the development of multiple concurrent definitions has resulted. The prevalence of the MetS is increasing to epidemic proportions not only in the United States and the remainder of the urbanized world but also in developing nations. Most studies show that the MetS is associated with an approximate doubling of cardiovascular disease risk and a 5-fold increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although it is unclear whether there is a unifying pathophysiological mechanism resulting in the MetS, abdominal adiposity and insulin resistance appear to be central to the MetS and its individual components. Lifestyle modification and weight loss should, therefore, be at the core of treating or preventing the MetS and its components. In addition, there is a general consensus that other cardiac risk factors should be aggressively managed in individuals with the MetS. Finally, in 2008 the MetS is an evolving concept that continues to be data driven and evidence based with revisions forthcoming},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Japanese Society of Snow and Ice. This paper outlines meteorological and glaciological observations of Glacier No. 31 in the Suntar-Khayata Range, east Siberia, obtained from 2012 to 2014. We set up meteorological instruments and seven stakes on the glacier for the purpose of measuring surface mass balance and flow velocity. The mean air temperature between July 8, 2012 and August 7, 2013 was -13.9°C at site 31-2 (2446 m a.s.l.) and the minimum temperature was -46.0°C. The air temperature on the glacier from November to April was approximately 10°C higher than that at Oymyakon village, suggesting a temperature inversion phenomenon, which typically occurs during winter in this region. The snow depth records show that snow increased at the beginning and end of winter, and that there was almost no change from the beginning of October until the end of April. The maximum snow depth from the previous summer was 158 cm at site 31-2 on May 28, 2013. The average annual surface mass balance for the 6 sites was -1256 mm water equivalent (w.e.) during the period from August 24, 2012 to August 16, 2013, indicating that ablation proceeded rapidly in all areas of the glacier. Surface flow velocity in 2013/2014 was 1.57 ma -1 at the approximate midpoint of the glacier, and was much slower than that measured during the IGY (International Geophysical Year) period (4.5 ma -1 ) in 1957/1958. The length and areal extent of the glacier were 3.85 km and 3.2 km 2 in 1958/1959 and 3.38 km and 2.27 km 2 in 2012/2013, respectively, showing a decrease over the last 54 years.},

abstract = {(Daiichi Fine Chemical Co Ltd, Takaoka, Japan)!!!!!!!!! Objectives—Advanced glycation endproducts, AGEs, and its specific receptor, RAGE, are involved in diabetic vascular complications. Endogenous secretory RAGE, esRAGE, has been identified as an alternatively spliced form of RAGE, and shown to act as a decoy receptor for AGE. Here, we measured plasma esRAGE level with a recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and examined its association with atherosclerosis in age- and gender-matched 203 type 2 diabetic and 134 nondiabetic subjects. Methods and Results—Plasma esRAGE was inversely associated with carotid or femoral atherosclerosis, as quantitatively measured as intimal-medial thickness (IMT) by arterial ultrasound. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that plasma esRAGE was the third strongest and independent factor associated with carotid IMT, following age and systolic blood pressure. Plasma esRAGE was significantly lower in diabetic patients (0.1760.092 ng/mL) than nondiabetic controls (0.2530.111). Of note, in all, diabetic or nondiabetic group, plasma esRAGE was significantly and inversely correlated with components of the metabolic syndrome including body mass index, blood pressure, triglyceride, HbA1c, or an insulin resistance index. Stepwise regression analyses showed that body mass index or insulin resistance index was the major factor determining plasma esRAGE in all, nondiabetic or diabetic population. Conclusions— esRAGE is a novel and potential protective factor for the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.},

Increased availability of palatable and energy dense foods, combined with a lack of physical activity overpower a homeostatic regulatory system that evolved to survive periods of famine rather than preventing obesity. Environmental and lifestyle factors influence energy balance mainly through their impact on cortico-limbic brain structures dealing with reward, cognitive, and social aspects of food intake and voluntary physical activity. To find new behavioral and pharmacological treatments of obesity, it will be important to identify the specific pathways that link these externally driven processes with the homeostatic regulatory system. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This report reviews findings from studies that have investigated whether abnormalities in reward from food intake and anticipated food intake increase risk for obesity. Self-report and behavioral data suggest that obese relative to lean individuals show elevated anticipatory and consummatory food reward. Brain imaging studies suggest that obese relative to lean individuals show greater activation of the gustatory cortex (insula/frontal operculum) and oral somatosensory regions (parietal operculum and Rolandic operculum) in response to anticipated intake and consumption of palatable foods. Yet, data also suggest that obese relative to lean individuals show less activation in the dorsal striatum in response to consumption of palatable foods and reduced striatal D2 dopamine receptor density. Emerging prospective data also suggest that abnormal activation in these brain regions increases risk for future weight gain and that genotypes associated with lowered dopamine signaling amplify these predictive effects. Results imply that individuals who show greater activation in the gustatory cortex and somatosensory regions in response to anticipation and consumption of food, but who show weaker activation in the striatum during food intake, may be at risk for overeating, particularly those at genetic risk for lowered dopamine receptor signaling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of dietary MFGM supplementation plus habitual exercise on the physical performance of middle-aged Japanese adults in a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-four subjects (men, n = 22; women, n = 22) were randomly assigned into two groups: one received placebo tablets (placebo group, n = 22 [men, n = 11; women, n = 11]), while the other received MFGM tablets (MFGM group, n = 22 [men, n = 11; women, n = 11]). The subjects ingested either MFGM (1 g/day) or placebo (1 g/day of whole milk powder) tablets every day for the 10-week study period and engaged in an exercise training program twice per week. A physical function test was performed at baseline and at 5 and 10 weeks. A significant group-by-time interaction was found for the side step test, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). In the placebo group, there were no significant intragroup differences. In the MFGM group, side step score and muscle CSA were significantly greater at 10 weeks compared to the baseline, and MFCV was significantly higher than that in the placebo group at 10 weeks. The changes in percentage of the side step score, muscle CSA, and MFCV in the MFGM group were significantly higher than in the placebo group at 10 weeks. These results suggest that daily MFGM ingestion combined with regular exercise might enhance physical performance such as agility in middle-aged adults.},

In black individuals, there is an increased risk of hypertension, stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease. There are no controlled studies of the effects of reducing salt intake on blood pressure and urine protein excretion in black individuals. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the effects of modest salt restriction on blood pressure and urine protein excretion in nondiabetic black hypertensive subjects. The study was randomized, double blind, and placebo controlled. After run-in periods on their usual diet and on reduced salt, participants continued to restrict their salt intake and then received either slow sodium tablets, designed to bring their salt intake back to normal, or placebo tablets for 4 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. In the 40 who completed the study, urinary sodium excretion fell on slow sodium to placebo from 169+/-73 to 89+/-52 mmol per 24 hours (P{\textless}0.001; approximately 10 to 5 g salt per day). Blood pressure fell from 159/101+/-13/8 to 151/98+/-13/8 mm Hg (P{\textless}0.01). Protein excretion fell from 93+/-48 mg to 75+/-30 mg per 24 hours (P{\textless}0.008). Thus, reducing salt intake from approximately 10 to 5 g per day reduced blood pressure and urine protein excretion in black hypertensives.

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate a revision of the Diet Quality Index called the Diet Quality Index Revised (DQI-R) Design: The original Diet Quality Index was revised to reflect current dietary guidance, to incorporate improved methods of estimating food servings, and to develop and incorporate measures of dietary variety and moderation. The scoring of the original scale was reversed in direction and expanded to a 100-point scale to improve interpretability. Methods/subjects: Data from the 1994 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals were used. A sample of 3,202 adults aged 18 and older contributed 2 days of dietary intake data based on 24-hour recalls for the development and revision of various components of the DQI-R. Statistical analyses: Pearson correlation analyses, ordinary least squares regression analyses, and a nonparametric test to determine trends across ordered groups were used. Results: The mean DQI-R score for the 1994 sample was 63.4 of a possible 100-point score. Sample respondents were more likely to have met dietary guidance in the areas of dietary cholesterol (66.9{\%} met goal) and iron intakes (59.6{\%} met goal) relative to the Recommended Dietary Allowances but less likely to have met goals related to fruit servings (19.6{\%} met goal), grain servings (23.1{\%} met goal), and calcium intakes (16.6{\%} met goal) relative to the Recommended Dietary Allowance. There is a statistically significant quantitative and qualitative improvement in all components of the DQI-R as one moves from the lowest grouping of scores to the highest. For example, persons with DQI-R scores less than 40 consumed 43.9{\%} of energy from fat, 72{\%} of the Adequate Intake for calcium, and 6.7{\%} of the recommended servings of fruit per day. In contrast, those with DQI-R scores greater than 80 consumed 24.2{\%} of energy from fat 101{\%} of the Adequate Intake for calcium, and 137{\%} of the recommended servings of fruit per day. Applications: The DQI- R reflects the dietary guidance principles of macronutrient distribution, moderation, variety, and proportionality. Although the index was designed to monitor dietary changes in populations rather than individuals, each index component reflects an aspect of national dietary guidance. Calculation of DQI-R scores for an individual should provide an estimate of diet quality relative to national guidelines, and differences in scores over time should suggest improvement or decline in overall diet quality.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that adipose tissue may negatively impact bone health, challenging the traditional paradigm that increased fat mass, through mechanical loading or endogenous estrogen production, is beneficial to the skeleton. We hypothesized that it is primarily the visceral compartment of body fat that is detrimental to bone metabolism, resulting in impaired bone density and architecture. In an age-stratified population sample of 218 women and 291 men (age 20-97 years), we assessed visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue areas at the L2-L3 interspace level by single slice quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and measured total body fat mass (TBF) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We then correlated these findings with volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) assessed by central QCT, and with vBMD and microstructural parameters at the ultradistal radius (UDR) by high resolution peripheral QCT (HRpQCT). In unadjusted analyses in postmenopausal women, TBF and SAT were positively correlated with total, trabecular, and cortical vBMD at the FN, LS, and UDR and with trabecular microstructure at the UDR. By contrast, VAT was not correlated with vBMD at the FN or LS but was positively correlated with UDR total and trabecular vBMD but not cortical vBMD. Adjustment for age or for bioavailable estradiol and testosterone levels reduced these correlations, while adjustment for body weight eliminated most positive associations. Assessment of the VAT/SAT ratio, however, demonstrated a negative relationship with vBMD at the FN and LS in postmenopausal women, a relationship eliminated when adjusted for age. Correlations between skeletal parameters and adipose measurements in pre-menopausal women and older men were weaker and mostly non-significant. In younger men, VAT was negatively associated with vBMD, cortical thickness, and trabecular microstructure at the UDR, and with LS vBMD and FN cortical vBMD. These associations generally remained after adjustment, with some negative associations (e.g., UDR cortical area) being accentuated. Similar results were found when the VAT/SAT ratio was correlated with FN vBMD in younger men; in contrast, VAT/SAT was positively correlated with FN vBMD in older men and this relationship was strengthened by age-adjustment. Together, our data suggest that adiposity has associations with bone that are age-, gender-, menopausal status-, adipose depot-, and bone compartment-specific. These novel observations warrant further investigations to establish any causal relationships.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recently, the analysis of dietary patterns has emerged as a possible approach to examining diet-disease relations. OBJECTIVE We examined the reproducibility and validity of dietary patterns defined by factor analysis using dietary data collected with a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). DESIGN We enrolled a subsample of men (n = 127) from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in a diet-validation study in 1986. A 131-item FFQ was administered twice, 1 y apart, and two 1-wk diet records and blood samples were collected during this 1-y interval. RESULTS Using factor analysis, we identified 2 major eating patterns, which were qualitatively similar across the 2 FFQs and the diet records. The first factor, the prudent dietary pattern, was characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, and fish and other seafood, whereas the second factor, the Western pattern, was characterized by a high intake of processed meat, red meat, butter, high-fat dairy products, eggs, and refined grains. The reliability correlations for the factor scores between the 2 FFQs were 0.70 for the prudent pattern and 0.67 for the Western pattern. The correlations (corrected for week-to-week variation in diet records) between the 2 FFQs and diet records ranged from 0.45 to 0.74 for the 2 patterns. In addition, the correlations between the factor scores and nutrient intakes and plasma concentrations of biomarkers were in the expected direction. CONCLUSIONS These data indicate reasonable reproducibility and validity of the major dietary patterns defined by factor analysis with data from an FFQ.},

abstract = {Background: Suppression of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors is associated with the increase of Lactobacillus in human gut microbiota. Gastric acid secretion is also suppressed by Helicobacter pylori infection and following atrophic gastritis. However, few studies have examined the association between H. pylori infection and Lactobacillus species in gut microbiota particularly in Japan. Methods: A total of 1,123 adult subjects who participated in a health survey in Hirosaki City were studied. Infection of H. pylori was defined by both serum antibody and stool antigen test. The presence and the severity of atrophic gastritis were defined by the serum level of serum pepsinogens. Using 16S ribosomal RNA amplification from fecal samples, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was calculated, and the composition ratio of each Lactobacillus species was surveyed. Results: The relative abundance of the Lactobacillus in H. pylori-infected subjects with severe atrophic gastritis was higher comparing with those in subjects with mild atrophic gastritis and without atrophic gastritis (0.591 vs 0.068{\%} and 0.033{\%}, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001) and also that of non-infected subjects (0.033{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). In H. pylori non-infected subjects, both gender and age were not associated with the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in fecal samples. The proportion of Lactobacillus salivarius was high in H. pylori-infected subjects while that of Lactobacillus acidophilus was high in non-infected subjects. Conclusion: Lactobacillus in human gut microbiota could be influenced by H. pylori infection and severity of atrophic gastritis in Japanese subjects.},

AIMS To prospectively investigate the association between dietary patterns and death from suicide. METHOD Participants were 40 752 men and 48 285 women who took part in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (1995-1998). Dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis of the consumption of 134 food and beverage items ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios of suicide from the fourth year of follow-up to December 2005 were calculated. RESULTS Among both men and women, a 'prudent' dietary pattern characterised by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, potatoes, soy products, mushrooms, seaweed and fish was associated with a decreased risk of suicide. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of suicide for the highest v. lowest quartiles of the dietary pattern score was 0.46 (95{\%} CI 0.28-0.75) (P for trend, 0.005). Other dietary patterns (Westernised and traditional Japanese) were not associated with suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that a prudent dietary pattern may be associated with a decreased risk of death from suicide.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The storage of adipose tissue in ectopic compartments is a hallmark attribute linking greater body mass index (BMI) with cardiometabolic diseases. Despite ample evidence to confirm that increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) deposition occurs with obesity, the interrelations between altered fat partitioning and regional muscle and bone quality are less well understood. OBJECTIVE We examined the association between adiposity and spinal muscle and bone quality across a large, heterogeneous cohort of adults. DESIGN We identified 8833 thoracic or abdominal computed tomography scans from patients in the University of Michigan Health System who were aged 18-64.9 y. We measured trabecular bone densities, cortical bone densities, VAT areas, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas at vertebral levels T7 to L5. Psoas muscle attenuation (an indicator of fat infiltration in muscle) was measured at the L4 level. RESULTS Muscle attenuation as well as trabecular and cortical bone densities revealed negative correlations with BMI, SAT, and VAT. The correlation between BMI and psoas attenuation was -0.321, between BMI and the density of cortical bone was -0.250, and between BMI and trabecular bone was -0.143 (all P {\textless} 0.001). However, correlations between VAT and lower muscle attenuation were stronger as were those between VAT and lower bone densities. Inverse correlations between VAT and densities of psoas muscle and cortical and trabecular bone were -0.460, -0.407, and -0.434, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). Even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, partial correlations between VAT, muscle attenuation, and bone densities remained significant at -0.250, -0.119, and -0.216, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Contrary to previous reports that high body mass is associated with increased bone quality, our data show a significant negative association between BMI and muscle and bone densities, suggesting fat infiltration into these tissues. More importantly, correlations between VAT and decreased bone and muscle densities remained statistically significant even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI.},

abstract = {Our previous study revealed the antihypertensive effects of green coffee bean extract (GCE) ingestion in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We suggested that this antihypertensive action was due to the fact that GCE contains chlorogenic acid (CQA) as a major phenolic compound, and CQA in turn contains ferulic acid as a metabolic component that acts on nitric oxide (NO) derived from the vascular endothelium. In this study, the effects of GCE on blood vessels were evaluated in healthy males. The subjects were 20 healthy males with reduced vasodilation responses measured by strain gauge plethysmograms (SPG) to ischemic reactive hyperemia. Of the 20 subjects, 10 (mean age, 37.2 years) ingested a test drink containing GCE (CQA: 140 mg/day), and the other 10 (mean age, 34.8 years) ingested a placebo drink for 4 months. During the ingestion period, SPG, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and serum biochemical parameters were measured, and acceleration plethysmograms (APG) were taken. The reactive hyperemia ratio (RHR) in the test drink group began to increase after ingestion for 1 month and was significantly higher (p {\textless}0.05) than that in the placebo group after ingestion for 3 months and 4 months. In addition, after ingestion for 4 months, the test drink group showed a significant decrease (p {\textless}0.01) in the plasma total homocysteine level compared with the pre-ingestion level. However, there were no significant differences in PWV or APG between the test drink group and the placebo drink group. The improvement in RHR after ingestion of a drink containing GCE suggested an improvement in vasoreactivity by this component.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Home blood pressure (BP) measurements are indispensable for the improvement of hypertension management in medical practice as well as for the recognition of hypertension in the population. The Working Group for Establishment of Guidelines for Measurement Procedures of Self-Monitoring of Blood Pressure at Home of the Japanese Society of Hypertension has established standards for all techniques and procedures of home BP measurements. The recommendations are as follows. RECOMMENDATION: 1) Arm-cuff devices based on the cuff-oscillometric method that have been validated officially, and the accuracy of which has been confirmed in each individual, should be used for home BP measurement. 2) The BP should be measured at the upper arm. Finger-cuff devices and wrist-cuff devices should not be used for home BP measurements. 3) Devices for home BP measurement should be adapted to the American Association for Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. In addition, the difference between the BP measured by the auscultatory method and that measured using the device should be within 5 mmHg in each individual. The home measurement device should be validated before use, and at regular intervals during use. 4) Home BP should be monitored under the following conditions. The morning measurement should be made within 1 h after waking, after micturition, sitting after 1 to 2 min of rest, before drug ingestion, and before breakfast. The evening measurement should be made just before going to bed, sitting after 1 to 2 min of rest. 5) Home BP should be measured at least once in the morning and once in the evening. 6) All home BP measurements should be documented without selection, together with the date, time, and pulse rate. Use of devices with a printer or an integrated circuit memory is useful to avoid selection bias. 7) The home BP in the morning and that in the evening should be averaged separately for a certain period. The first measurement on each occasion should be used for totaling. 8) Home BP values averaged for a certain period indicate hypertension when 135/80 mmHg and over and definite hypertension when 135/85 mmHg and over. Normotension is defined as less than 125/80 mmHg and definite normotension as less than 125/75 mmHg. Home BP measurements based on these guidelines can be considered an appropriate tool for clinical decision-making, and it is hoped that these guidelines will serve to reduce confusion and confirm the place of home BP measurement in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Shrinkage of empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) of posterior individual parameters in mixed-effects models has been shown to obscure the apparent correlations among random effects and relationships between random effects and covariates. Empirical quantification equations have been widely used for population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models. The objectives of this manuscript were (1) to compare the empirical equations with theoretically derived equations, (2) to investigate and confirm the influencing factor on shrinkage, and (3) to evaluate the impact of shrinkage on estimation errors of EBEs using Monte Carlo simulations. A mathematical derivation was first provided for the shrinkage in nonlinear mixed effects model. Using a linear mixed model, the simulation results demonstrated that the shrinkage estimated from the empirical equations matched those based on the theoretically derived equations. Simulations with a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model verified that shrinkage has a reversed relationship with the relative ratio of interindividual variability to residual variability. Fewer numbers of observations per subject were associated with higher amount of shrinkage, consistent with findings from previous research. The influence of sampling times appeared to be larger when fewer PK samples were collected for each individual. As expected, sample size has very limited impact on shrinkage of the PK parameters of the two-compartment model. Assessment of estimation error suggested an average 1:1 relationship between shrinkage and median estimation error of EBEs.},

abstract = {Background: Regular self-weighing has been a focus of attention recently in the obesity literature. It has received conflicting endorsement in that some researchers and practitioners recommend it as a key behavioral strategy for weight management, while others caution against its use due to its potential to cause negative psychological consequences associated with weight management failure. The evidence on frequent self-weighing, however, has not yet been synthesized. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the evidence regarding the use of regular self-weighing for both weight loss and weight maintenance. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO online databases. Reviewed studies were broken down by sample characteristics, predictors/conditions, dependent measures, findings, and evidence grade. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, but nearly half received low evidence grades in terms of methodological quality. Findings from 11 of the 12 reviewed studies indicated that more frequent self-weighing was associated with greater weight loss or weight gain prevention. Specifically, individuals who reported self-weighing weekly or daily, typically over a period of several months, held a 1 to 3 kg/m(2) (current) advantage over individuals who did not self-weigh frequently. The effects of self-weighing in experimental studies, especially those where self-weighing behaviors could be isolated, were less clear. Conclusion: Based on the consistency of the evidence reviewed, frequent self-weighing, at the very least, seems to be a good predictor of moderate weight loss, less weight regain, or the avoidance of initial weight gain in adults. More targeted research is needed in this area to determine the causal role of frequent self-weighing in weight loss/weight gain prevention programs. Other open questions to be pursued include the optimal dose of self-weighing, as well as the risks posed for negative psychological consequences.},

abstract = {Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, is currently used by over {\$}500M{\$} users and is considered to be a proxy of Chinese social life. In this study, we contrast the discussions occurring on Sina Weibo and on Chinese language Twitter in order to observe two different strands of Chinese culture: people within China who use Sina Weibo with its government imposed restrictions and those outside that are free to speak completely anonymously. We first propose a simple ad-hoc algorithm to identify topics of Tweets and Weibo. Different from previous works on micro-message topic detection, our algorithm considers topics of the same contents but with different $\backslash${\#}tags. Our algorithm can also detect topics for Tweets and Weibos without any $\backslash${\#}tags. Using a large corpus of Weibo and Chinese language tweets, covering the period from January {\$}1{\$} to December {\$}31{\$}, {\$}2012{\$}, we obtain a list of topics using clustered $\backslash${\#}tags that we can then use to compare the two platforms. Surprisingly, we find that there are no common entries among the Top {\$}100{\$} most popular topics. Furthermore, only {\$}9.2\backslash{\%}{\$} of tweets correspond to the Top {\$}1000{\$} topics on Sina Weibo platform, and conversely only {\$}4.4\backslash{\%}{\$} of weibos were found to discuss the most popular Twitter topics. Our results reveal significant differences in social attention on the two platforms, with most popular topics on Sina Weibo relating to entertainment while most tweets corresponded to cultural or political contents that is practically non existent in Sina Weibo.},

abstract = {A non-invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) or brain-computer interface is a technology for helping individuals with disabilities and utilizes neurophysiological signals from the brain to control external machines or computers without requiring surgery. However, when applying electroencephalography (EEG) methodology, users must place EEG electrodes on the scalp each time, and the development of easy-to-use electrodes for clinical use is required. In this study, we developed a conductive non-adhesive solid-gel electrode for practical non-invasive BMIs. We performed basic material testing, including examining the volume resistivity, viscoelasticity, and moisture-retention properties of the solid-gel. Then, we compared the performance of the solid-gel, a conventional paste, and an in-house metal-pin-based electrode using impedance measurements and P300-BMI testing. The solid-gel was observed to be conductive (volume resistivity 13.2 $\Omega$cm) and soft (complex modulus 105.4 kPa), and it remained wet for a prolonged period ({\textgreater}10 h) in a dry environment. Impedance measurements revealed that the impedance of the solid-gel-based and conventional paste-based electrodes was superior to that of the pin-based electrode. The EEG measurement suggested that the signals obtained with the solid-gel electrode were comparable to those with the conventional paste-based electrode. Moreover, the P300-BMI study suggested that systems using the solid-gel or pin-based electrodes were effective. One of the advantages of the solid-gel is that it does not require cleaning after use, whereas the conventional paste adheres to the hair, which requires washing. Furthermore, the solid-gel electrode was not painful compared with a metal-pin electrode. Taken together, the results suggest that the solid-gel electrode worked well for practical BMIs and could be useful for bedridden patients such as those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

abstract = {Many current popular weight-loss diets advocate restricting carbohydrates, but risks and benefits of these diets for patients with diabetes is unclear. We searched for articles published in English between 1980 and April 2006 regarding carbohydrate-restricted diets that included and reported separate results for adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes. Articles were limited to studies completed in the United States and Canada. Available data on study design; carbohydrate composition of diet; duration of diet; and the outcomes of weight, lipid levels (total, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides), hemoglobin A1c percent and/or fasting glucose were extracted. A total of 56 studies or reviews were evaluated. Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-regression analyses show that hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, and some lipid fractions (triglycerides) improved with lower carbohydrate-content diets. Overall effect on weight was equivocal among the studies evaluated in this meta-analysis. Randomized, controlled studies of restricted-carbohydrate diets in patients with diabetes need to be conducted in order to evaluate the overall sustainability of outcomes and long-term safety. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Dietetic Association.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The long-term health consequences of diets used for weight control are not established. We have evaluated the association of the frequently recommended low carbohydrate diets - usually characterized by concomitant increase in protein intake - with long-term mortality. DESIGN: The Women's Lifestyle and Health cohort study initiated in Sweden during 1991-1992, with a 12-year almost complete follow up. SETTING: The Uppsala Health Care Region. SUBJECTS: 42,237 women, 30-49 years old at baseline, volunteers from a random sample, who completed an extensive questionnaire and were traced through linkages to national registries until 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated the association of mortality with: decreasing carbohydrate intake (in deciles); increasing protein intake (in deciles) and an additive combination of these variables (low carbohydrate-high protein score from 2 to 20), in Cox models controlling for energy intake, saturated fat intake and several nondietary covariates. RESULTS: Decreasing carbohydrate or increasing protein intake by one decile were associated with increase in total mortality by 6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0-12{\%}) and 2{\%} (95{\%} CI: -1 to 5{\%}), respectively. For cardiovascular mortality, amongst women 40-49 years old at enrolment, the corresponding increases were, respectively, 13{\%} (95{\%} CI: -4 to 32{\%}) and 16{\%} (95{\%} CI: 5-29{\%}), with the additive score being even more predictive. CONCLUSIONS: A diet characterized by low carbohydrate and high protein intake was associated with increased total and particularly cardiovascular mortality amongst women. Vigilance with respect to long-term adherence to such weight control regimes is advisable.},

abstract = {Dominant alleles at the agouti locus (A) cause an obesity syndrome in the mouse, as a consequence of ectopic expression of the agouti peptide. This peptide, normally only found in the skin, is a high-affinity antagonist of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor (MC1-R), thus explaining the inhibitory effect of agouti on eumelanin pigment synthesis. The agouti peptide is also an antagonist of the hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R). To test the hypothesis that agouti causes obesity by antagonism of hypothalamic melanocortin receptors, we identified cyclic melanocortin analogues that are potent agonists or antagonists of the neural MC3 (refs 11, 12) and MC4 receptors. Intracerebroventricular administration of the agonist, MTII, inhibited feeding in four models of hyperphagia: fasted C57BL/6J, ob/ob, and A(Y) mice, and mice injected with neuropeptide Y. Co-administration of the specific melanocortin antagonist and agouti-mimetic SHU9119 completely blocked this inhibition. Furthermore, administration of SHU9119 significantly enhanced nocturnal feeding, or feeding stimulated by a prior fast. Our data show that melanocortinergic neurons exert a tonic inhibition of feeding behaviour. Chronic disruption of this inhibitory signal is a likely explanation of the agouti obesity syndrome.},

abstract = {The inability to detect associations between diet and serum cholesterol in cross-sectional population studies has been attributed to measurement error in diet assessments and between-subject variability in lipid concentrations. Current statistical methods can reduce the effects of measurement error and allow within-subject comparisons when replicate measures on individuals are available, even if the time between replicates is as long as 4 y and replicate data are not available for all subjects. Data from 928 nondiabetic participants of the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study with measures of 24-h dietary intake and fasting lipid concentrations at baseline, at a 4-y follow-up visit, or both were analyzed in a random-effects model that allowed for an unbalanced design. Sex was included as a non-time-varying covariate and age, body mass index, and energy intake were included as time-varying covariates. The findings when LDL cholesterol (mmol/L) was regressed on saturated fat intake (20 g/d) with all observations in a random-effects model (beta = 0.14, P = 0.0016) were compared with results with observations restricted to the first visit only (beta = 0.05, P = 0.52), a balanced design using averages across visits (beta = -0.12, P = 0.28), and a balanced design with random effects obtained by excluding subjects without two observations (beta = 0.12, P = 0.0092). Study power was greatest in the random-effects model using all observations and time-varying covariates. These findings highlight the importance of even a single replicate observation on a subsample of subjects. We recommend analyzing all data rather than averaging measures across visits or omitting observations to create a balanced design.},

abstract = {Compositional data, containing relative information, occur regularly in many disciplines and practical situations. Multivariate statistics methods including regression analysis have been adopted to model compositional data, but the existing research is still scattered and fragmented. This paper contributes to modeling the linear regression relationship for compositional data as both dependent and independent variables. First, some operations in Simplex space, such as the perturbation operation, the power transformation, and the inner product, are defined for compositional-data vectors. The regression models are then built by the original compositional data and transformed data, respectively, after the introduction of the Isometric Logratio Transformation (ilr). By theoretical inference, it turns out that the two models are equivalent in essence using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. Two measures for testing goodness of fit, i.e., the observed squared correlation coefficient R2and the cross validated squared correlation coefficient Q2, are also proposed to evaluate the regression models. Besides, the estimated regression parameters are explained to indicate the notion of relative elasticity. An empirical analysis finally illustrates the usefulness of the multiple linear regression models for compositional-data variables. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper describes recent work to redesign the software structure in order to simplify its use and provide a uniform interface, permitting easier modification and customization. We describe the key features of this software, followed by examples of its use. One general issue with inverse problem software is the difficulty of correctly implementing algorithms and the consequent ease with which subtle numerical bugs can be inadvertently introduced. EIDORS helps with this issue, by allowing sharing and reuse of well-documented and debugged software. On the other hand, since EIDORS is designed to facilitate use by non-specialists, its use may inadvertently result in such numerical errors. In order to address this issue, we develop a list of ways in which such errors with inverse problems (which we refer to as 'cheats') may occur. Our hope is that such an overview may assist authors of software to avoid such implementation issues.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There are few data on the comparative epidemiology and virology of the pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus and cocirculating seasonal influenza A viruses in community settings. METHODS We recruited 348 index patients with acute respiratory illness from 14 outpatient clinics in Hong Kong in July and August 2009. We then prospectively followed household members of 99 patients who tested positive for influenza A virus on rapid diagnostic testing. We collected nasal and throat swabs from all household members at three home visits within 7 days for testing by means of quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay and viral culture. Using hemagglutination-inhibition and viral-neutralization assays, we tested baseline and convalescent serum samples from a subgroup of patients for antibody responses to the pandemic and seasonal influenza A viruses. RESULTS Secondary attack rates (as confirmed on RT-PCR assay) among household contacts of index patients were similar for the pandemic influenza virus (8{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3 to 14) and seasonal influenza viruses (9{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 5 to 15). The patterns of viral shedding and the course of illness among index patients were also similar for the pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. In a subgroup of patients for whom baseline and convalescent serum samples were available, 36{\%} of household contacts who had serologic evidence of pandemic influenza virus infection did not shed detectable virus or report illness. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus has characteristics that are broadly similar to those of seasonal influenza A viruses in terms of rates of viral shedding, clinical illness, and transmissibility in the household setting.},

For the first time both the blood protein adducts and the urinary metabolites of AA and glycidamide (GA) were quantified in an especially designed study group with even distribution of age and gender. The hemoglobin adducts N-carbamoylethylvaline (AAVal) and N-( R, S)-2-hydroxy-2-carbamoylethylvaline (GAVal) were detected by GC-MS/MS in all blood samples with median levels of 30 and 34 pmol/g of globin, respectively. Concentrations ranged from 15 to 71 pmol/g of globin for AAVal and from 14 to 66 pmol/g of globin for GAVal. The ratio GAVal/AAVal was 0.4-2.7 (median = 1.1). The urinary metabolites were determined by LC-MS/MS. Of all urine samples examined 99{\%} of N-acetyl- S-(2-carbamoylethyl)- l-cysteine (AAMA) levels and 73{\%} of N-( R/ S)-acetyl- S-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl)- l-cysteine (GAMA) levels were above the LOD (1.5 microg/L). Concentrations ranged from {\textless}LOD to 229 microg/L (median = 29 microg/L) for AAMA and from {\textless}LOD to 85 microg/L (median = 7 microg/L) for GAMA. The ratio of GAMA/AAMA varied from 0.004 to 1.4 (median = 0.3). Using hemoglobin adduct levels in blood and mercapturic acid excretion in urine for calculation of daily AA intake gave practically identical values. The median daily intakes were 0.43 (0.21-1.04) microg/kg of body weight(bw)/day using Hb adducts and 0.51 ({\textless}LOD-2.32) microg/kg of bw/day using mercapturic acids for calculations. Children take up approximately 1.3-1.5 times more AA per kilogram of body weight than adults. The ratio GAMA/AAMA is significantly higher in the group of young children (6-10 years) with a median level of 0.5. A gender-related difference in internal exposure and metabolism was not observed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coffee is the most abundantly consumed stimulant worldwide. However, its cardiovascular safety remains controversial. Possible health hazards have been related to its main ingredient, caffeine. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system by coffee may enhance cardiovascular risk; however, it is unclear whether this effect of coffee is related to caffeine or other substance(s) also contained in decaffeinated coffee. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 15 healthy volunteers (6 habitual and 9 nonhabitual coffee drinkers) arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nervous activity (MSA) were continuously recorded before and after drinking a triple espresso or a decaffeinated triple espresso or after intravenous administration of caffeine (250 mg) or placebo (saline) in the same subjects. There was a significant time x condition interaction for the intravenous caffeine and placebo conditions for MSA, with caffeine showing a significant increase in MSA at 60 minutes (53.2+/-14.1{\%} total activity) and the placebo group showing no effect. A similar significant time effect was found for coffee drinking (54.1+/-22.5{\%} total activity). Habitual and nonhabitual coffee drinkers demonstrated similar changes in MSA and BP after intravenous caffeine, whereas coffee drinking increased BP in nonhabitual drinkers only, despite comparable increases of MSA and plasma caffeine levels. Nonhabitual coffee drinkers showed similar activation of MSA and BP after caffeine infusion, coffee, or decaffeinated coffee. CONCLUSIONS: Acutely, coffee and caffeine induced comparable increases in MSA and BP in nonhabitual coffee drinkers, whereas habitual coffee drinkers exhibited lack of BP increase despite MSA activation to coffee. Because decaffeinated coffee also increases BP and MSA in nonhabitual drinkers, ingredients other than caffeine must be responsible for cardiovascular activation.},

abstract = {The protective effect of total fat mass on bone mineral density (BMD) has been challenged with studies showing no or negative association after adjusting for weight. Subsequently, more studies have evaluated the relationship of regional adiposity with BMD, and findings were inconsistent for central obesity. Advancements in imaging techniques enable us to directly and noninvasively study the role of adiposity on skeletal health. Visceral adiposity measured by computed tomography (CT) has consistently been shown to have negative effects on bone. Availability of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) also allows us to noninvasively quantify bone marrow fat (BMF), which has been known to be associated with osteoporosis from histomorphometric studies. Using MRS along with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, studies have reported a detrimental role of BMF on BMD. With the increase in aging and obesity of the population, it is important to continue this effort in identifying the contribution of adipose tissues to bone quality and fracture.},

@article{Scharfetter2005,
abstract = {In a previous publication, it was demonstrated that the abdominal subcutaneous fat layer thickness (SFL) is strongly correlated with the abdominal electrical impedance when measured with a transversal tetrapolar electrode arrangement. This article addresses the following questions: 1) To which extent do different abdominal compartments contribute to the impedance? 2) How does the hydration state of tissues affect the data? 3) Can hydration and fat content be assessed independently? For simulating the measured data a hierarchical electrical model was built. The abdomen was subdivided into three compartments (subcutaneous fat, muscle, mesentery). The true anatomical structure of the compartment boundaries was modeled using finite-element modeling (FEM). Each compartment is described by an electrical tissue model parameterized in physiological terms. Assuming the same percent change of the fat fraction in the mesentery and the SFL the model predicts a change of 1,24 omega/mm change of the SFL compared to 1,1 omega/mm measured. 42{\%} of the change stem from the SFL, 56{\%} from the mesentery and 2{\%} from changes of fat within the muscle compartment. A 1{\%} increase of the extracellular water in the muscle is not discernible from a 1{\%} decrease of the SFL. The measured data reflect not only the SFL but also the visceral fat. The tetrapolar electrode arrangement allows the measurement of the abdominal fat content only if the hydration remains constant.},

abstract = {Vaccine efficacy in the field is often derived from the relative attack rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated after an outbreak. In this paper, vaccine efficacy is defined in terms of the probability that the infectious agent is transmitted from an infected to a susceptible person, and a method for estimating it from the usual attack rate data is given. We explore two mechanisms of vaccine action defined by Smith et al, but include an underlying dynamic epidemic model of an acute directly transmitted disease. We show analytically that under the model in which the vaccine mechanism reduces the probability of infection given a certain exposure, vaccine efficacy based on the relative attack rates underestimates the protective effect of the vaccine based on the relative transmission probabilities. Under the other model in which the vaccine mechanism offers complete protection to a certain proportion of those vaccinated, and no protection to the other vaccinated proportion, the vaccine efficacy based on the relative attack rates will equal that based on the transmission probabilities. Parameters for the effectiveness of a vaccination programme are defined in terms of the direct and indirect benefit to a single person as well as the total and average benefit to the entire population, and derived from the dynamic model for an outbreak of an acute directly transmitted disease. These effects can also be estimated without an actual separate unvaccinated population, independent of assumptions about the vaccine mechanism. The variation of these measures as functions of the fraction of vaccinated people in the population is explored numerically.},

abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) can be detected in freshly-voided human urine from healthy subjects and has been proposed as a "biomarker" of oxidative stress. This paper summarizes our studies to examine the extent to which urinary H(2)O(2) measurement fulfils the criteria for the "ideal biomarker". Levels of H(2)O(2), standardised for creatinine, varied widely between subjects. In most subjects, levels also varied considerably when measurements were made at different times and on different days. A reproducible increase in urinary H(2)O(2) was detected in all subjects examined after drinking coffee, a beverage rich in H(2)O(2). By contrast, green tea decreased urinary H(2)O(2) levels. We conclude that the H(2)O(2) in coffee is not excreted into urine. Instead, hydroxyhydroquinone from coffee is absorbed, excreted and oxidises in urine to produce H(2)O(2). No other confounders of urinary H(2)O(2) have been identified to date. Work is underway to compare H(2)O(2) levels with variations in other biomarkers of oxidative damage, to test the possibility that there are daily or other periodic variations in oxidative damage rates.},

abstract = {Obesity is associated with lower serum 25(OH)D level via several mechanisms including sequestration of fat soluble vitamin D in increased fat mass. Since obesity is the major cause of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, lower serum 25(OH)D level is also associated with these conditions. Non-surgical weight reduction, especially that results in decreased visceral fat mass, is associated with an improvement in insulin resistance and a small but significant increase in serum 25(OH)D level. Whether the latter is independently associated with the former is not known. Plural meta-analyses reported that vitamin D supplementation per se without life-style intervention is not associated with a significant weight reduction. However, recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in which large doses vitamin D over 2,000 IU/day supplemented to type 2 diabetes patients revealed a small but significant improvement in indices of insulin resistance and glycemic control. The beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism appeared to be more prominent in non-obese subjects in whom higher serum 25(OH)D level were attained, suggesting potential benefits of vitamin D on glucose metabolism is not mediated by weight or fat mass control.},

Methods The subjects included 303 men (average age 51.3+/-9.0 years old) and 345 women (average age 40.0+/-9.4 years old). The VFA and SFA were estimated by BCM, and the associations among the components of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, blood pressure and related blood sample tests) were evaluated. Results VFA showed positive correlations with waist circumference, HbA1c, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride and uric acid level in men, while showing positive correlations with waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride and HbA1c in women. The estimated SFA showed positive correlations with systolic blood pressure, HDL/LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in men, and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride in women. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed the estimated VFA to be as effective as WC to identify subject with metabolic syndrome. Conclusion By estimating the VFA using BCM, it may be possible to identify patients at risk of developing metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia.},

Loss of NO(.) associated with these traditional risk factors may in part explain why they predispose to atherosclerosis. Among many enzymatic systems that are capable of producing ROS, xanthine oxidase, NADH/NADPH oxidase, and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase have been extensively studied in vascular cells. As the role of these various enzyme sources of ROS become clear, it will perhaps be possible to use more specific therapies to prevent their production and ultimately correct endothelial dysfunction.},

Second, the method was applied to a more realistic system of human whole blood, and the inherent coagulation process was monitored without artificial acceleration by a coagulation initiator. The time dependence of the permittivity at a frequency around 1 MHz showed a distinct peak at a time that corresponds to the clotting time. Our theoretical modeling revealed that the evolution of heterogeneity and the sedimentation in the system cause the peak of the permittivity.},

abstract = {Humans are biologically adapted to their ancestral food environment in which foods were dispersed and energy expenditure was required to obtain them. The modern developed world has a surplus of very accessible, inexpensive food. Amid the enormous variety of different foods are "super" foods, such as chocolate, which are particularly appealing and calorie dense. Energy output can be minimal to obtain large amounts of food. In terms of education (eg, in nutrition and risk-benefit thinking) and environment design, modern cultures have not kept pace with changes in the food world. Overweight and worrying about food result from this mismatch between human biological predispositions and the current food environment. The French have coped with this mismatch better than Americans. Although at least as healthy as Americans, they focus more on the experience of eating and less on the health effects of eating. They spend more time eating, but they eat less, partly because of smaller portion sizes. French traditions of moderation (versus American abundance), focus on quality (versus quantity), and emphasis on the joys of the moment (rather than making life comfortable and easy) support a healthier lifestyle. The French physical environment encourages slow, moderate social eating, minimal snacking, and more physical activity in daily life. {\textcopyright}2005 Society for Nutrition Education.},

abstract = {Muscle activities are generally measured with surface electromyography (sEMG). However, the individual muscle activities are quite difficult to obtain because of superimposition of the sEMG signals called "crosstalk problems". The crosstalk is highly complicated in a forearm having a number of muscles in the small volume. A method to resolve the crosstalk to become able to measure individual activities of muscles would be useful. This paper proposes a method for reverse-estimating the individual muscle activities in the forearm from the sEMG distribution using an EMG conduction model. The individual muscle activities were calculated by conforming the measured sEMG distribution to the simulated results of the mathematical model. To verify the reverse-estimation results, physical work experiments were carried out for three subjects applying a flexion load with weights (0.5kg, 0.75kg, 1kg) to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger. The muscle activation values were calculated from the measured sEMG. The results show there are significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in the activation of flexor digitorum superficialis in all combinations of the loads in all subjects. Kinesiologically, the simulation method proposed here was able to estimate individual activation values. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {Objective: We examined the representativeness of the sample used in the National Nutrition Survey in Japan (J-NNS). Methods: The distribution of the J-NNS sample from 1995 to 2000 was compared with that of the national census with respect to gender, age group, place of residence, and number of household members. Results: In the survey sample, as compared with the national census distributions, the proportion of females was 1{\%} to 2{\%} larger, the proportion of individuals who were 20 to 39 y of age was a few percentages smaller, and a slight bias toward rural areas was seen. Among individuals who were 20 to 59 y of age, the proportion of individuals who lived in single-person households was 50{\%} to 66{\%} of that found in the national census. Observed disparities between the sample and the population were minimal except in the case of the proportion of individuals who lived alone. Conclusions: The sample used in the J-NNS is generally representative of the entire Japanese population with the exception of individuals in single-person households. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The sensory experience of food is a primary reinforcer of eating and overeating plays a major role in the development of human obesity. However, whether the sensory experience of a forthcoming meal and the associated physiological phenomena (cephalic phase response, expectation of reward), which prepare the organism for the ingestion of food play a role in the regulation of energy intake and contribute to the development of obesity remains largely unresolved. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and 15O-water to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and to assess the brain's response to the oral administration of 2 ml of a liquid meal (Ensure Plus, 1.5 kcal/ml) after a 36-h fast and shortly before consuming the same meal. Twenty-one obese (BMI {\textgreater} 35 kg/m2, 10M/11F, age 28 ± 6 years, body fat 40 ± 6{\%}) and 20 lean individuals (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m 2, 10M/10F, age 33 ± 9 years, body fat 21 ± 7{\%}) were studied. Compared to lean individuals, obese individuals had higher fasting plasma glucose (83.3 ± 6.2 vs. 75.5 ± 9.6 mg/dl; P = 0.0003) and insulin concentrations (6.1 ± 3.5 vs. 2.5 ± 1.7 $\mu$U/ml; P {\textless} 0.0001) and were characterized by a higher score of dietary disinhibition (i.e., the susceptibility of eating behavior to emotional factors and sensory cues, 5.7 ± 3.6 vs. 3.5 ± 2.7; P = 0.01) assessed by the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire. In response to the sensory experience of food, differences in rCBF were observed in several regions of the brain, including greater increases in the middle-dorsal insula and midbrain, and greater decreases in the posterior cingulate, temporal, and orbitofrontal cortices in obese compared to lean individuals (P {\textless} 0.05, after small volume correction). In a multiple regression model, percentage of body fat (P = 0.04), glycemia (P = 0.01), and disinhibition (P = 0.07) were independent correlates of the neural response to the sensory experience of the meal in the middle-dorsal insular cortex (R 2 = 0.45). We conclude that obesity is associated with an abnormal brain response to the sensory aspects of a liquid meal after a prolonged fast especially in areas of the primary gustatory cortex. This is only partially explained by the elevated glycemia and high level of disinhibition which characterize individuals with increased adiposity. These results provide a new perspective on the understanding of the neuroanatomical correlates of abnormal eating behavior and their relationship with obesity in humans.},

abstract = {In electrical impedance tomography an approximation for the internal resistivity distribution is computed based on the knowledge of the injected currents and measured voltages on the surface of the body. It is often assumed that the injected currents are confined to the two-dimensional (2-D) electrode plane and the reconstruction is based on 2-D assumptions. However, the currents spread out in three dimensions and, therefore, off-plane structures have significant effect on the reconstructed images. In this paper we propose a finite element-based method for the reconstruction of three-dimensional resistivity distributions. The proposed method is based on the so-called complete electrode model that takes into account the presence of the electrodes and the contact impedances. Both the forward and the inverse problems are discussed and results from static and dynamic (difference) reconstructions with real measurement data are given. It is shown that in phantom experiments with accurate finite element computations it is possible to obtain static images that are comparable with difference images that are reconstructed from the same object with the empty (saline filled) tank as a reference.},

abstract = {The global activity is an important confound when analyzing PET data in that its inclusion in the statistical model can substantially reduce error variance and increase sensitivity. However, by defining global activity as the average over all voxels one introduces a bias that is collinear with experimental factors. This leads to an underestimation of true activations and the introduction of artefactual deactivations. We propose a novel estimator for the global activity based on the notion of finding a maximally nonlocal mode in a multivariate characterization of the data, while maximizing the locality of the remaining modes. The approach uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to find a provisional set of modes, which are subsequently rotated such that a metric based on the above heuristic is maximized. This metric is a version of the stochastic sign change (SSC) criterion that has been used previously for normalizing medical images with focal defects. The estimator was evaluated on simulated and real functional imaging (PET) data. The simulations show that the bias of the global mean, introduced by focal activations, is reduced by 80-90{\%} with the new estimator. Comparison with a previous unbiased estimator, using the empirical data, yielded similar results. The advantage of the new estimator is that it is not informed of experimental design and relies only on general assumptions regarding the nature of the signal. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the combined and separate effects of exercise and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) supplementation on frailty, physical function, physical activity level, and hematological parameters in community-dwelling elderly Japanese women. METHODS A total of 131 frail, elderly women over 75 years were randomly assigned to one of four groups: exercise and MFGM supplementation (Ex+MFGM), exercise and placebo (Ex+Plac), MFGM supplementation, or the placebo group. The exercise group attended a 60-minute training program twice a week for three months, and the MFGM group ingested 1g of the MFGM supplement in pill form, daily for 3 months. The primary outcome measure was change in frailty status based on Fried's frailty phenotype. Secondary outcome measures included body composition, physical function and hematological parameters, and interview survey components assessing lifestyle factors. Participants were followed for 4 months post-intervention. RESULTS Significant group × time interactions were observed for usual walking speed (P = 0.005), timed up {\&} go (P{\textless}0.001), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3/insulin-like growth factor 1 ratio (P = 0.013). The frailty components revealed that weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow walking speed were reversed, but low muscle strength did not significantly changed. Frailty reversal rate was significantly higher in the Ex+MFGM (57.6{\%}) than in the MFGM (28.1{\%}) or placebo (30.3{\%}) groups at post-intervention ($\chi$2 = 8.827, P = 0.032), and at the follow-up was also significantly greater in the Ex+MFGM (45.5{\%}) and Ex+Plac (39.4{\%}) groups compared with the placebo (15.2{\%}) group ($\chi$2 = 8.607, P = 0.035). The exercise+MFGM group had the highest odds ratio (OR) for frailty reversal at post-intervention and follow-up (OR = 3.12, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-8.60; and OR = 4.67, 95{\%} CI = 1.45-15.08, respectively). CONCLUSION This study suggests that interventions including exercise and nutrition can improve frailty status. Statistically significant additive effects of MFGM with exercise could not be confirmed in this population, and further investigation in larger samples is necessary.

abstract = {AbstractFeline caudofemoralis (CF) is a promising preparation in which to study the properties of mammalian fast-twitch skeletal muscle, but little is known about its muscle fiber properties, architecture, and motor innervation. We used histochemical techniques to confirm that it contained predominantly type IIB fibers (952{\%}, n=8, with six of eight muscles composed exclusively of type IIA and IIB fibers), but physiological experiments showed less fatiguability than for the type IIB component of medial gastrocnemius. This may be related to the surprisingly strong and regular recruitment of CF during repetitive tasks such as walking and trotting, which we demonstrated electromyographically. We measured muscle length over the anatomical range of motion for CF (0.61.2 L0) and estimated working length during walking and trotting (0.951.15 L0). The specific tension was similar to that of the exclusively slow-twitch soleus muscle (31.24.7 N/cm2 compared with 31.84.1 N/cm2; P0.8). Single fiber dissections of CF revealed a series-fibered architecture with a mean of 2.3 fibers, each 2.5 cm long, required to span the fascicle length. We identified two neuromuscular compartments in CF by cutting one of the two nerve branches innervating CF and depleting the glycogen stores in the intact motor units. These compartments were in parallel and extended the length of the muscle; their electromyographic activity was similar during various natural behaviors. CF and gluteus maximus motoneurons were labeled concurrently with a combination of fluorescent, retrograde tracers including Fluororuby, Fluorogold and Fast Blue. The CF motor nucleus was located in L7-S1, overlapping and intermingling extensively with the nucleus of the adjacent gluteus maximus muscle. Distributions of CF motoneuron diameter revealed one large peak around 5055 m, with relatively few small-diameter (less than 35 m) cells. Using estimates of the total number of fibers in three muscles and the estimated number of -motoneurons for those same muscles, we calculated a mean innervation ratio of 270, which is at the low end of the innervation ratios for type IIB motor units from other feline muscles and more similar to type IIA motor units. In general, CF appears to be a useful preparation in which to study the properties of fast-twitch muscle, but these properties may vary somewhat from type IIB fibers from different muscles.},

In molecular medicine and biotechnology, tissue electroporation is performed with electrodes placed in the target area of the body. Currently, tissue electroporation, as with all other methods of molecular medicine, is performed without real-time control or near-term information regarding the extent and degree of electroporation. This paper expands the work from our previous study by implementing new ex vivo experimental data with "front-tracking" analysis for the image reconstruction algorithm. The experimental data is incorporated into numerical simulations of electroporation procedures and images are generated using the new reconstruction algorithm to demonstrate that electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can produce an image of the electroporated area. Combining EIT with electroporation could become an important biotechnological and medical technique to introduce therapeutic molecules into cells in tissue at predetermined areas of the body.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle tissue holds a large volume of water partitioned into extracellular water (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW) fractions. As the ECW may not be related to muscle strength directly, we hypothesized that excluding ECW from muscle volume would strengthen the correlation with muscle strength. METHODS: A total of 119 healthy men aged 20-88 years old participated in this study. Knee isometric extension strength, vertical jump, and standing from a chair were measured as indices of muscle strength and power in the lower extremities. The regional lean volume (LV), total water (TW), ICW, and ECW in the lower leg were estimated by anthropometry (skinfold and circumference measurements) and segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (S-BIS). Then, we calculated the ECW/TW and ICW/TW ratios. RESULTS: Although ICW and the LV index decreased significantly with age (p {\textless} .001), no significant changes in ECW were observed (p = .134). Consequently, the ECW/TW ratio increased significantly (p {\textless} .001) with age (young adult, 27.0 +/- 2.9{\%}; elderly, 34.3 +/- 4.9{\%}; advanced elderly, 37.2 +/- 7.0{\%}). Adjusting for this by including the ICW/TW ratio in our models significantly improved the correlation between the LV index and strength-related measurements and correlated with strength-related measurements independently of the LV index (p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: The ECW/TW ratio increases in the lower leg with age. The results suggest that the expansion of ECW relative to ICW and the LV masked actual muscle cell atrophy with aging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS Visceral fat (VF) compared with subcutaneous fat (SF) is more closely associated with cardiometabolic disease. Dietary vitamin A (retinol) may reduce adiposity through its effects on adipogenesis differentially in VF and SF, and this effect may be modulated by retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4). We investigated whether intake of vitamin A is associated with either VF or SF, and whether this association is moderated by the RBP4 genotype (rs10882272, C/T) previously associated with circulating retinol levels. METHODS This was a cross-sectional association study in a sample of 947 adolescents from a French-Canadian founder population. VF and SF were quantified with magnetic resonance imaging, and vitamin A intake was assessed with a 24-hour food recall. All participants were genotyped to determine their RBP4 variant. RESULTS Dietary intake of vitamin A was negatively associated with VF; however, it was not associated with SF. These relationships were independent of age, sex, height and energy intake, and were modulated by the RBP4 variant. The T allele promoted adiposity-reducing effects of vitamin A in VF and adiposity-enhancing effects in SF, while the C allele had adiposity-reducing effects in both VF and SF. CONCLUSIONS Dietary vitamin A may reduce abdominal adiposity and promote visceral to subcutaneous body fat redistribution during adolescence in an RBP4-dependent manner. These observational findings provide the basis for future interventional studies, which together with genetic information may inject further causality in the association between dietary vitamin A intake and abdominal adiposity.},

Acute intake of coffee or beverages containing caffeine can increase blood pressure, heart minute volumes, and cardiac index, as well as activate the sympathetic nervous system in nonhabitual coffee drinkers. Interestingly, this is not observed in habitual coffee drinkers. Restriction of coffee or caffeinated beverages is no longer indicated in the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines for the treatment of hypertension. In fact, no clear association between coffee and the risk of hypertension, myocardial infarction, or other cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated. In contrast to early studies, recent research indicates that habitual moderate coffee intake does not represent a health hazard and may even be associated with beneficial effects on cardiovascular health.},

The environment uses a wiring$\backslash$nanalogy that resembles electrical circuit diagrams rather than abstract$\backslash$nprogramming code. The goal of high interactivity of the simulation$\backslash$nwas attained by allowing the program to run in continuously repeating$\backslash$nloops. This makes the program behave flexibly to the user input.$\backslash$nThe programming is described with the aid of a 2-compartment PK simulation.$\backslash$nExamples of more sophisticated simulation programs are also given$\backslash$nwhere the PK/PD simulation shows drug input, concentrations in plasma,$\backslash$nand at effect site and the effects themselves as a function of time.$\backslash$nA multi-compartmental model of morphine, including metabolite kinetics$\backslash$nand effects is also included.

In this paper, it is shown that for objects consisting of a small number of homogeneous materials, the reconstruction resolution can be substantially increased without altering the acquisition process. A super-resolution reconstruction approach is introduced that is based on discrete tomography, in which prior knowledge about the materials in the object is assumed. Discrete tomography has already been used to create reconstructions from a low number of projection angles, but in this paper, it is demonstrated that it can also be applied to increase the reconstruction resolution. Experiments on simulated and real $\mu$CT data of bone and foam structures show that the proposed method indeed leads to significantly improved structure segmentation and quantification compared with what can be achieved from conventional reconstructions.},

abstract = {In older adults, as in younger individuals, habitual moderate-intensity physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of various chronic health conditions, including certain types of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease and certain forms of cancer. However, the pattern of physical activity associated with such benefits remains unclear. One problem is that most investigators have examined patterns of physical activity using either subjective questionnaires or accelerometer or pedometer measurements limited to a single week, despite clear evidence of both the unreliability/invalidity of questionnaires and seasonal changes in activity patterns. Since 2000, we have thus conducted an interdisciplinary study examining the habitual physical activity and health of elderly people living in a medium-sized Japanese town (the Nakanojo Study). In about one-tenth of some 5000 available subjects aged {\textgreater} or =65 years, physical activity has already been assessed continuously for 24 h/day for {\textgreater}8 years using a specially adapted pedometer/accelerometer. This device has a storage capacity of 36 days and can distinguish {\textgreater}10 intensities of physical activity (expressed in metabolic equivalents [METs]). Data have to date been summarized as daily step counts and daily durations of activity of {\textless}3 and {\textgreater}3 METs, averaged over a 1-year period. This article provides a detailed overview of both factors influencing habitual physical activity and relationships between such activity and health in an elderly population. To date, analyses have been cross-sectional in type. Substantial associations have been noted between the overall health of participants and both the daily duration of effort undertaken at an intensity of {\textgreater}3 METs and the daily step count. In men, the extent of health is associated more closely with the daily duration of activity of {\textgreater}3 METs than with the daily step count, whereas in women, the association is closer for the step count than for the duration of activity {\textgreater}3 METs. In both sexes, the threshold amount of physical activity associated with better health is greater for physical than for mental benefits: {\textgreater}8000 versus {\textgreater}4000 steps/day and/or {\textgreater}20 versus {\textgreater}5 min/day at an intensity {\textgreater}3 METs, respectively. In other words, better physical health is seen in those spending at least 20 min/day in moderate walking (at a pace of around 1.4 m/s [5 km/h]) and a further {\textgreater}60 min of light activity per day. In contrast, better mental health is associated with much smaller amounts of deliberate physical activity. The daily step count and the daily durations of activity of {\textless}3 and {\textgreater}3 METs are all influenced by meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature. Activity decreases exponentially to about 4000 steps/day as precipitation increases. Excluding the influence of rainfall, the daily step count peaks at a mean outdoor temperature of around 17 degrees C; above and especially below such readings, physical activity decreases as a quadratic function of temperature. Seasonal changes in microclimate should thus be considered when designing interventions intended to increase the habitual physical activity of elderly people. The observed associations between physical activity and health outcomes point to a need for longitudinal analyses; these should examine potential causal interpretations of the current findings and elucidate possible additional mediating variables.},

abstract = {Retinoids are vitamin A (retinol) derivatives and complex regulators of adipogenesis by activating specific nuclear receptors, including the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). Circulating retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and its membrane receptor STRA6 coordinate cellular retinol uptake. It is unknown whether retinol levels and the activity of RAR and RXR in adipocyte precursors are linked via RBP4/STRA6. Here, we show that STRA6 is expressed in precursor cells and, dictated by the apo- and holo-RBP4 isoforms, mediates bidirectional retinol transport that controls RAR$\alpha$ activity and subsequent adipocyte differentiation. Mobilization of retinoid stores in mice by inducing RBP4 secretion from the liver activated RAR$\alpha$ signaling in the precursor cell containing the stromal-vascular fraction of adipose tissue. Retinol-loaded holo-RBP4 blocked adipocyte differentiation of cultured precursors by activating RAR$\alpha$. Remarkably, retinol-free apo-RBP4 triggered retinol efflux that reduced cellular retinoids, RAR$\alpha$ activity, and target gene expression and enhanced adipogenesis synergistically with ectopic STRA6. Thus, STRA6 in adipocyte precursor cells links nuclear RAR$\alpha$ activity to the circulating RBP4 isoforms, whose ratio in obese mice was shifted toward limiting the adipogenic potential of their precursors. This novel cross talk identifies a retinol-dependent metabolic function of RBP4 that may have important implications for the treatment of obesity.},

abstract = {Obesity has been traditionally considered to protect the skeleton against osteoporosis and fracture. Recently, body fat, specifically visceral adipose tissue (VAT), has been associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk for some types of fractures. We studied VAT and bone microarchitecture in 710 participants (58{\%} women, age 61.3 ± 7.7 years) from the Framingham Offspring cohort to determine whether cortical and trabecular BMD and microarchitecture differ according to the amount of VAT. VAT was measured from CT imaging of the abdomen. Cortical and trabecular BMD and microarchitecture were measured at the distal tibia and radius using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). We focused on 10 bone parameters: cortical BMD (Ct.BMD), cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD), cortical porosity (Ct.Po), cortical thickness (Ct.Th), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.A/Tt.A), trabecular density (Tb.BMD), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), total area (Tt.Ar), and failure load (FL) from micro-finite element analysis. We assessed the association between sex-specific quartiles of VAT and BMD, microarchitecture, and strength in all participants and stratified by sex. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and in women, menopausal status, then repeated adjusting for body mass index (BMI) or weight. At the radius and tibia, Ct.Th, Ct.A/Tt.A, Tb.BMD, Tb.N, and FL were positively associated with VAT (all p-trend {\textless}0.05), but no other associations were statistically significant except for higher levels of cortical porosity with higher VAT in the radius. Most of these associations were only observed in women, and were no longer significant when adjusting for BMI or weight. Higher amounts of VAT are associated with greater BMD and better microstructure of the peripheral skeleton despite some suggestions of significant deleterious changes in cortical measures in the non-weight bearing radius. Associations were no longer significant after adjustment for BMI or weight, suggesting that the effects of VAT may not have a substantial effect on the skeleton independent of BMI or weight. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern recognition innate immune molecule, inhibits influenza A virus infection in vitro. MBL deficiency due to gene polymorphism in humans has been associated with infection susceptibility. These clinical observations were confirmed by animal model studies, in which mice genetically lacking MBL were susceptible to certain pathogens, including herpes simplex virus 2. RESULTS We demonstrate that MBL is present in the lung of na{\"{i}}ve healthy wild type (WT) mice and that MBL null mice are more susceptible to IAV infection. Administration of recombinant human MBL (rhMBL) reverses the infection phenotype, confirming that the infection susceptibility is MBL-mediated. The anti-viral mechanisms of MBL include activation of the lectin complement pathway and coagulation, requiring serum factors. White blood cells (WBCs) in the lung increase in WT mice compared with MBL null mice on day 1 post-infection. In contrast, apoptotic macrophages (M$\Phi$s) are two-fold higher in the lung of MBL null mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, MBL deficient macrophages appear to be susceptible to apoptosis in vitro. Lastly, soluble factors, which are associated with lung injury, are increased in the lungs of MBL null mice during IAV infection. These results suggest that MBL plays a key role against IAV infection. CONCLUSION MBL plays a key role in clearing IAV and maintaining lung homeostasis. In addition, our findings also suggest that MBL deficiency maybe a risk factor in IAV infection and MBL may be a useful adjunctive therapy for IAV infection.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the validation and verification of a machine-learning based Bayesian network of breast pathology co-occurrence. The present/not present occurrences of 29 common breast pathologies from 1631 pathology reports were used to build the network. All pathology reports were developed by a single pathologist. The resulting network has 25 diagnosis nodes interconnected by 40 arcs. Each arc represents a predicted co-occurrence or null co-occurrence. Model verification involved assessing the robustness of the original network structure after random exclusion of 25{\%}, 50{\%}, and 75{\%} of the pathology report dataset. The structure of the network appears stable as random removal of 75{\%} of the records in the original dataset leaves 81{\%} of the original network intact. Model validation was primarily assessed by review of the breast pathology literature for each arc in the network. Almost all network identified co-occurrences (95{\%}) have been published in the breast pathology literature or were verified by expert opinion. In conclusion, the Bayesian network of breast pathology co-occurrence presented here is both robust with respect to incomplete data and validated by consistency with the breast pathology literature and by expert opinion. Further, the ability to utilize a specific pathology observation to predict multiple co-current pathologies enables exploration of pathology co-occurrence patterns in an intuitive manner that may have broader application in both the breast pathologist clinical community and the breast cancer research community. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Abstract$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nBackground and Objective:  Diabetes and periodontitis are associated with each other. Adipokines, specifically adiponectin and resistin, are secreted from adipocytes and are thought to cause insulin resistance in rodents. Additionally, adiponectin and resistin may play a role in inflammation and immune responses. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between serum levels of adipokines and periodontal conditions in elderly Japanese people with and without periodontitis.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMaterial and Methods:  A total of 158 Japanese men and women (76 years old) with or without periodontitis were selected for the study. Serum adiponectin, resistin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) concentrations were compared between subjects with and without periodontitis.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults:  Serum resistin levels and total leukocyte counts in subjects with periodontitis were higher than in control subjects. No significant differences were observed in adiponectin, IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$ levels between subjects with and without periodontitis. Logistic regression analysis showed that periodontitis with at least one tooth that displayed a probing pocket depth of ≥6 mm was significantly associated with higher serum resistin levels (odds ratio, 2.0; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.0–4.0). When excluding periodontitis subjects with ≤10{\%} of bleeding on probing and excluding control subjects with {\textgreater}10{\%} bleeding on probing, differences between groups and odds ratio increased. Serum adiponectin tended to decrease in patients with periodontitis, albeit not significantly.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusion:  Increased serum resistin levels were significantly associated with periodontal condition, especially when considering bleeding on probing, in elderly Japanese people. There was also a trend, though non-significant, toward decreased levels of adiponectin in subjects with periodontitis.},

abstract = {Obesity and overweight are important risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus type 2 and associated chronic diseases, and therefore, they have become serious global problems in the western and developed countries. But little is known about the neuroanatomical correlates of eating behavior and its influences on the central nervous processing in humans. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the cortical activation in 12 lean healthy humans during visual stimulation with food-related and nonfood pictures after a fasting period of at least 5 h. Compared to the nonfood pictures, the food stimuli elicited a significantly greater activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex and the insular/opercular cortex bilaterally with a stronger focus on the left side. Subjective ratings of appetite during the presentation of food-related stimuli modulated the activity in the insula bilaterally, the left operculum and the right putamen. These results provide further insights in the central nervous processing of food relevant stimuli in humans, specifically with respect to the subjective experience of appetite. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Hunger and satiety have conventionally provided the framework for understanding eating and overeating. We argue that hunger and satiety play a relatively small role in everyday eating. The normative control of food intake refers to the fact that our eating is largely governed by the motive to avoid eating excessively. Dieters impose a restrictive intake norm on themselves, but often violate the norm. Personal norms are individualized rules that people develop to help themselves decide how much is appropriate to eat in a given situation. Situational norms are derived from the eating situation itself; examples include portion size and social influence, which exert powerful effects on intake. We discuss the implications of a normative approach to the analysis of eating and overeating. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess standardized whole body adipose tissue topography in a cohort of subjects at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and to compare fat distribution in subgroups regarding anthropometric (age, body mass index [BMI]) and metabolic parameters (insulin sensitivity). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 80 volunteers (40 females, 40 males) underwent T1-weighted MR imaging of the entire body. Standardized adipose tissue (AT) profiles were calculated considering the different body structure of the participants. The measured data were interpolated to a defined number of sampling points enabling a direct comparison of the profiles independent on body structure. Resulting mean profiles and region-dependent standard deviations of four age groups and three BMI-groups were compared for females and males. Correlations between insulin sensitivity and body fat distribution were analyzed. RESULTS: Reliable adipose tissue profiles could be obtained from all volunteers. In BMI-matched subgroups, females show significant higher AT and subcutaneous abdominal AT (P {\textless} 0.05 both), but lower visceral AT (P {\textless} 0.01) compared to the males. Furthermore, visceral AT increases with age, as shown in the matched age groups. In both gender groups, insulin-resistant subjects are characterized by higher visceral adipose tissue (VAT) compared to insulin-sensitive subjects. In addition, profiles of insulin-resistant subjects show more AT in the shoulder/neck region but less AT in the upper extremities. CONCLUSION: Standardized assessment of whole body AT profiles based on T1-weighted MRI provides a reliable basis for interindividual comparison of the body fat distribution and allows a fast and reliable quantification of total body adipose tissue and the distribution of different AT components as subcutaneous and visceral fat in different body regions. Differences in standardized profiles might enable an early identification of people at risk of metabolic disorders, as not only the amount but also the distribution of AT is expected to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.},

We sought to test the hypothesis that SFA intake is associated inversely with risk of stroke and its subtypes and positively with coronary heart disease among Japanese, whose average SFA intake is lower than that of Westerners. Methods and results The Japan Public Health Center-based prospective Study involves two subcohorts: Cohort I, aged 45-64 in 1995 and followed-up through 2009, and Cohort II, aged 45-74 in 1998 and followed-up through 2007. A total of 38 084 men and 43 847 women were included in this report. Hazards ratios for incident total stroke, ischaemic stroke, intraparhenchymal haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death across quintiles of dietary SFAs were examined. We found inverse associations between SFA intake and total stroke [multivariable hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) for the highest vs. lowest quintiles = 0.77 (0.65-0.93), trend P = 0.002], intraparenchymal haemorrhage [0.61 (0.43-0.86), P for trend = 0.005], and ischaemic stroke [0.84 (0.67-1.06), trend P = 0.08], primarily for deep intraparenchymal haemorrhage [0.67 (0.45-0.99), P for trend = 0.04] and lacunar infarction [0.75 (0.53, 1.07), trend P = 0.02]. We also observed a positive association between SFAs intake and myocardial infarction [1.39 (0.93-2.08), trend P = 0.046] primarily among men. No associations were observed between SFAs intake and incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage or sudden cardiac death. Conclusions In this Japanese population, SFAs intake was inversely associated with deep intraparenchymal haemorrhage and lacunar infarction and positively associated with myocardial infarction.},

We quantified effects of sleep, sleep deprivation and recovery sleep on whole-body total daily energy expenditure (EE) and on EE during the habitual day and nighttime. We also determined effects of sleep stage during baseline and recovery sleep on EE. Seven healthy participants aged 22 ± 5 years (mean ± s.d.) maintained ∼8 h per night sleep schedules for 1 week before the study and consumed a weight-maintenance diet for 3 days prior to and during the laboratory protocol. Following a habituation night, subjects lived in a whole-room indirect calorimeter for 3 days. The first 24 h served as baseline – 16 h wakefulness, 8 h scheduled sleep – and this was followed by 40 h sleep deprivation and 8 h scheduled recovery sleep. Findings show that, compared to baseline, 24 h EE was significantly increased by ∼7{\%} during the first 24 h of sleep deprivation and was significantly decreased by ∼5{\%} during recovery, which included hours awake 25-40 and 8 h recovery sleep. During the night time, EE was significantly increased by ∼32{\%} on the sleep deprivation night and significantly decreased by ∼4{\%} during recovery sleep compared to baseline. Small differences in EE were observed among sleep stages, but wakefulness during the sleep episode was associated with increased energy expenditure. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that sleep conserves energy and that sleep deprivation increases total daily EE in humans.},

We identified two independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with circulating retinol levels, which are located near the transthyretin (TTR) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) genes which encode major carrier proteins of retinol: rs1667255 (P =2.30× 10(-17)) and rs10882272 (P =6.04× 10(-12)).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a new dietary education (NDE) program in reducing plasma glucose (PG) levels in Japanese male workers at high risk for type 2 diabetes through a randomized controlled trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 173 high-risk men (mean age, 55 years) to either the NDE or the control (conventional dietary education) group. Each subject in the NDE group received two individualized interventions especially aimed at reducing total energy intake at dinner by modifying dietary intake. The control group received conventional group counseling. An "overintake/underintake fraction" for total energy intake was used to measure the status of dietary intake. Our hypothesis was that the NDE group would have a 10{\%} decrease in 2-h PG 1 year after the start of the education. Outcome measures were compared with ANCOVA by adjusting for baseline values. RESULTS: The NDE group had a significantly lower total energy intake at dinner and daily than the control group. The adjusted differences in changes from baseline in the absolute value of the 'overintake/underintake fraction' were -15.3{\%} (95{\%} CI -24.6 to -6.0{\%}, P = 0.002) for dinner and -6.0{\%} (-9.8 to -2.2{\%}, P = 0.002) for daily [corrected]. The NDE group had a decreased 2-h PG after 1 year, whereas that value was increased in the control group. The adjusted difference in the percent change of 2-h PG was significant (-15.2{\%}, -22.0 to -8.4{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001).

During the positron emission tomography experiment, subjects performed advanced trail-making tests, touching the target circles in sequence located on the display of a touch-panel screen. In order to identify the brain regions associated with fatigue sensation, correlation analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping method. The brain region exhibiting a positive correlation in activity with subjective sensation of fatigue, measured immediately after each positron emission tomography scan, was located in medial orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 10/11). Hence, the medial orbitofrontal cortex is a brain region associated with mental fatigue sensation. Our findings provide a new perspective on the neural basis of fatigue.},

The system was designed based on a tri-polar concentric electrode unit and on a principle of the capacitive electrode involving the conductive electrodes, the cloth, and the skin. A pilot sensor and detecting circuit using this design were assembled and evaluated to explore the feasibility of this approach. The experimental results showed that the Laplacian EMG obtained in this way was comparable and synchronized with the surface EMG obtained using traditional bipolar electrodes, although its S/N was reduced. Though there are still a lot of challenges to be addressed to achieve practical performances, it seems promising for use in human-machine interfaces because the proposed approach eliminates discomfort due to conventional electrode-to-skin coupling.},

abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between muscle and bone status in elderly individuals. Our results suggested links between sarcopenia and osteoporosis; impairment in muscle status (i.e., muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance) is associated with deterioration in bone mass and texture subsequently leading to an increased risk of fracture. Introduction Accumulating evidence has shown associations between sarcopenia and osteoporosis, but existing studies face inconsistencies in the clinical definition of both conditions. Thus, we sought to investigate bone health among older individuals with or without muscle health impairment. Methods We conducted an analysis of cross-sectional data available from the Sarcopenia and Physical Impairment with Advancing Age (SarcoPhAge) study. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) (i.e., a low muscle mass plus either low muscle strength or low physical performance). Muscle mass and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Muscle strength was assessed using a hand dynamometer, and physical performance was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery test. Using the cutoff limits proposed by the EWGSOP, we have classified women in the Blow SMI group{\^{}} when its value was {\textless} 5.50 kg/m 2 , in the Blow muscle strength group{\^{}} when strength was {\textless} 20 kg, and in the Blow physical performance group{\^{}} when SPPB {\textless} 8 points. The thresholds of {\textless} 7.26 kg/m 2 (for SMI), {\textless} 30 kg (for muscle strength), and SPPB {\textless} 8 points were used for men. The 10-year fracture risk was obtained using the FRAX{\textregistered} tool. Moreover, bone texture was determined using the trabecular bone score (TBS) method. Results The study sample consisted of 288 older subjects aged 74.7 ± 5.7 years, and 59.0{\%} of the subjects were women. Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 43 individuals (14.9{\%}), and osteoporosis was diagnosed in 36 subjects (12.5{\%}). Moreover, aBMD values were, most of the time, lower in older men and women with muscle impairment (i.e., low muscle mass, low muscle strength, and low physical performance). For these subjects, we also noted a higher probability of fracture. When comparing bone quality, there were no significant differences in the TBS values between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older men and women or between those with low and high muscle mass. However, when controlling for confounders (i.e., age, BMI, number of co-morbidities, smoking status, and nutritional status), TBS values were lower in older women with low muscle strength (p = 0.04) and in older men with low physical performance (p = 0.01). Conclusions Our study showed interrelationships between components of sarcopenia and osteoporosis, with older subjects with muscle impairment having poorer bone health.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between dietary patterns and obesity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: A total of 3760 Japanese female dietetic course students aged 18-20 years from 53 institutions in Japan. MEASUREMENTS: Diet was assessed over a 1-month period with a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire with 148 food items, from which 30 food groups were created and entered into a factor analysis. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported body height and weight. RESULTS: Mean BMI (+/-s.d.) was 20.9+/-2.8 kg m(-2). Four dietary patterns were identified. After adjustment for several confounding factors and total energy intake, the 'Healthy' pattern, characterized by high intakes of vegetables, mushrooms, seaweeds, potatoes, fish and shellfish, soy products, processed fish, fruit and salted vegetables, was significantly associated with a lower risk of BMI{\textgreater} or =25 (odds ratio of the highest quintile vs lowest, 0.57; 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.37-0.87; P for trend {\textless}0.05). In contrast, the 'Japanese traditional' pattern, characterized by high intakes of rice, miso soup and soy products, and the 'Western' pattern, characterized by high intakes of meats, fats and oils, seasonings, processed meats and eggs, were both significantly associated with an increased risk of BMI{\textgreater} or =25 (OR: 1.77; 95{\%} CI: 1.17-2.67; P for trend {\textless}0.01 and OR: 1.56; 95{\%} CI: 1.01-2.40; P for trend=0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Three major dietary patterns, Healthy, Japanese traditional and Western, were all independently and significantly related to the risk of obesity even among a relatively lean young Japanese female population.},

@article{Ames2018,
abstract = {It is proposed that proteins/enzymes be classified into two classes according to their essentiality for immediate survival/reproduction and their function in long-term health: that is, survival proteins versus longevity proteins. As proposed by the triage theory, a modest deficiency of one of the nutrients/cofactors triggers a built-in rationing mechanism that favors the proteins needed for immediate survival and reproduction (survival proteins) while sacrificing those needed to protect against future damage (longevity proteins). Impairment of the function of longevity proteins results in an insidious acceleration of the risk of diseases associated with aging. I also propose that nutrients required for the function of longevity proteins constitute a class of vitamins that are here named "longevity vitamins." I suggest that many such nutrients play a dual role for both survival and longevity. The evidence for classifying taurine as a conditional vitamin, and the following 10 compounds as putative longevity vitamins, is reviewed: the fungal antioxidant ergothioneine; the bacterial metabolites pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and queuine; and the plant antioxidant carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, $\alpha$- and $\beta$-carotene, $\beta$-cryptoxanthin, and the marine carotenoid astaxanthin. Because nutrient deficiencies are highly prevalent in the United States (and elsewhere), appropriate supplementation and/or an improved diet could reduce much of the consequent risk of chronic disease and premature aging.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the results of a study which compares lung density values obtained from electrical impedance tomography (EIT), clinical diagnosis and CT values (HU) within a region of interest in the lung. The purpose was to assess the clinical use of lung density estimation using EIT data. In 11 patients supported by a mechanical ventilator, the consistency of regional lung density measurements as estimated by EIT was validated to assess the feasibility of its use in intensive care medicine. There were significant differences in regional lung densities recorded in the supine position between normal lungs and diseased lungs associated with pneumonia, atelectasis and pleural effusion (normal; 240 ± 71.7 kg m(-3), pneumonia; 306 ± 38.6 kg m(-3), atelectasis; 497 ± 130 kg m(-3), pleural effusion; 467 ± 113 kg m(-3): Steel-Dwass test, p {\textless} 0.05). In addition, in order to compare lung density with CT image pixels, the image resolution of CT images, which was originally 512 × 512 pixels, was changed to 16 × 16 pixels to match that of the EIT images. The results of CT and EIT images from five patients in an intensive care unit showed a correlation coefficient of 0.66 ± 0.13 between the CT values (HU) and the lung density values (kg m(-3)) obtained from EIT. These results indicate that it may be possible to obtain a quantitative value for regional lung density using EIT.},

The obese phenotype of the ob/ob mouse is linked to a mutation in the obese gene that results in expression of a truncated inactive protein. Human and rat homologues for this gene are known. Previous experiments predict such a hormone to have a hypothalamic target. Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y stimulates food intake, decreases thermogenesis, and increases plasma insulin and corticosterone levels making it a potential target. Here we express the obese protein in Escherichia coli and find that it suppresses food intake and decreases body weight dramatically when administered to normal and ob/ob mice but not db/db (diabetic) mice, which are thought to lack the appropriate receptor. High-affinity binding was detected in the rat hypothalamus. One mechanism by which this protein regulated food intake and metabolism was inhibition of neuropeptide-Y synthesis and release.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Although muscle mass is beneficial to bone, studies on the effect of fat mass on bone have yielded conflicting results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the relations between lean and fat mass and bone structure. DESIGN: This study was cross-sectional. SETTING: The study was conducted in a general community. SUBJECTS: Subjects included 300 healthy sexually mature adolescents and young adults (150 males and 150 females) between the ages of 13 and 21 yr. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We investigated the relation between dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures of total body fat and lean mass and bone values obtained with DXA (legs and lumbar spine bone mineral density and bone mineral content) and computed tomography (CT) (cross-sectional and cortical bone areas of the femurs and cross-sectional area and cancellous bone density of the vertebrae). RESULTS: Simple and multiple linear regression analyses showed significant positive relations between DXA lean mass and all CT and DXA measures of bone in the axial and appendicular skeletons (all P {\textless} 0.005). In contrast, whereas Pearson correlations between DXA measures of fat mass and bone parameters were generally positive, multiple regression analyses showed that fat mass, after accounting for lean mass, trunk height/leg length, had a negative, or no, correlation with CT and DXA values for bone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide compelling evidence that, despite increased mechanical loading and independent of lean mass, adipose tissue is not beneficial to bone structure.},

abstract = {Childhood studies of the fat-bone relationship are conflicting, possibly reflecting the influence of metabolic abnormalities in some but not all obese children. Bone mass was compared between prepubertal overweight children with (n = 41) and without (n = 99) prediabetes. Associations of bone mass with measures of total and central adiposity, glucose intolerance, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, systemic inflammation, and osteocalcin also were determined. In 140 overweight children aged 7 to 11 years, an oral glucose tolerance test was used to identify those with prediabetes and for determination of glucose, 2-hour glucose, glucose area under the curve (AUC), insulin, 2-hour insulin, and insulin AUC. Blood samples also were assessed for lipids, C-reactive protein, and osteocalcin. Total-body bone mineral content (BMC), fat-free soft tissue mass (FFST), and fat mass (FM) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) were assessed using MRI. Total-body BMC was 4{\%} lower in overweight children with prediabetes than in those without prediabetes after controlling for sex, race, height, and weight (p = .03). In the total sample, FM was positively related with BMC ($\beta$ = 0.16, p = .01) after adjusting for sex, race, height, and FFST. However, VAT ($\beta$ = -0.13, p = .03) and SAAT ($\beta$ = -0.34, p = .02) were inversely associated with BMC after controlling for sex, race, height, FFST, FM, and SAAT or VAT. No significant associations were found between BMC and the biochemical measurements. Prepubertal overweight children with prediabetes may be at risk for poor skeletal development. In addition, it appears that greater levels of central rather than total adiposity may be deleterious for developing bone.},

abstract = {This study develops a longitudinal perspective on consumer confidence in the safety of food to explore if, how, and why consumer confidence changes over time. In the first study, a theory-based monitoring instrument for consumer confidence in the safety of food was developed and validated. The monitoring instrument assesses consumer confidence together with its determinants. Model and measurement invariance were validated rigorously before developments in consumer confidence in the safety of food and its determinants were investigated over time. The results from the longitudinal analysis show that across four waves of annual data collection (200320132006), the framework was stable and that the relative importance of the determinants of confidence was, generally, constant over time. Some changes were observed regarding the mean ratings on the latent constructs. The second study explored how newspaper coverage of food safety related issues affects consumer confidence in the safety of food through subjective consumer recall of food safety incidents. The results show that the newspaper coverage on food safety issues is positively associated with consumer recall of food safety incidents, both in terms of intensity and recency of media coverage.},

abstract = {Ever since Julius Wolff proposed the law of bone transformation in the 19th century, it has been widely known that the trabecular structure of cancellous bone adapts functionally to the loading environment. To understand the mechanism of Wolff's law, a three-dimensional (3D) computer simulation of trabecular structural changes due to surface remodeling was performed for a human proximal femur. A large-scale voxel finite element model was constructed to simulate the structural changes of individual trabeculae over the entire cancellous region. As a simple remodeling model that considers bone cellular activities regulated by the local mechanical environment, nonuniformity of local stress was assumed to drive the trabecular surface remodeling to seek a uniform stress state. Simulation results demonstrated that cell-scale (???10 ??m) remodeling in response to mechanical stimulation created complex 3D trabecular structures of the entire bone-scale (???10 cm), as illustrated in the reference of Wolff. The bone remodeling reproduced the characteristic anisotropic structure in the coronal cross section and the isotropic structures in other cross sections. The principal values and axes of a structure characterized by fabric ellipsoids corresponded to those of the apparent stress of the structure. The proposed large-scale computer simulation indicates that in a complex mechanical environment of a hierarchical bone structure of over 104 length scale (from ???10 ??m to ???10 cm), a simple remodeling at the cellular/trabecular levels creates a highly complex and functional trabecular structure, as characterized by bone density and orientation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objective: To test the association of endometrial cancer with the lymphotoxin-$\alpha$ (LT$\alpha$) C804A and A252G polymorphisms, a hospital-based incident case-control study was performed in Japanese subjects. Methods: The cases comprised 110 endometrial cancer patients, and the controls were 220 age-matched cancer-free females. Results: The LT$\alpha$ C804A and A252G polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium. We performed conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, which revealed that the LT$\alpha$ 252AG and 804CA variant genotypes were associated with a significantly reduced risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.51, 95{\%} CI = 0.31-0.86, P = 0.011). Being homozygous of the LT$\alpha$ 252G and 804A alleles was not associated with the risk of endometrial cancer. However, the presence of at least one variant LT$\alpha$ allele was associated with a significantly lower risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.54, 95{\%} CI = 0.33-0.87, P = 0.012). After adjusting for potential confounders (body mass index, age at menarche, parity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of endometrial cancer, hormone replacement therapy, smoking status, and alcohol consumption), the risk of endometrial cancer was significantly lower both in carriers of one variant allele and in carriers of either one or two of the variant alleles (OR = 0.47, 95{\%} CI = 0.26-0.85, P = 0.017; OR = 0.50, 95{\%} CI = 0.28-0.89, P = 0.019; respectively). Conclusion: The results suggest that these LT$\alpha$ polymorphisms play an important role in the tumorigenesis of endometrial cancer. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects on employee vegetable intake of a long-term intervention in an employee work cafeteria. METHODS: The subjects were approximately 1,200 employees (aged 19-61 years) of an industrial company in Fukui prefecture. We promoted the intake of typical Japanese style meals that combined three elements (staple foods, main dishes and vegetable dishes) to increase vegetables intake. We displayed all items on the menus of the employee cafeteria using three colors (yellow, red and green to denote three elements) to indicate healthy food choices for the maintenance of a healthy food environment. We advised employees to choose meals containing the three elements at the time of payment, for nutritional education (appropriate portion choice: APC). We evaluated the ratio of APC at the same time. To calculate the mean daily intake per person, we carried out a questionnaire survey similar to the "semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire" and asked about the frequency and approximate intake of vegetables. RESULTS: The APC was 63.5{\%} after one year of intervention, significantly increased to 82.1{\%} after two years (p {\textless} 0.001), and was 80.0{\%} after three years of intervention (p {\textless} 0.001). Vegetable intake at breakfast (p {\textless} 0.001), lunch (p {\textless} 0.001) and dinner (p = 0.011), and from vegetable juice (p = 0.030) significantly increased after three years of intervention. The consumption of pickles significantly decreased after three years of intervention (p = 0.009). It was estimated that the vegetable intake of men increased from 167.3 to 184.6 g, and that of women from 157.9 to 187.7 g. CONCLUSIONS: Employee estimated vegetable intake was significantly increased and that of pickles was significantly decreased by a long-term intervention (three years) in the employee work cafeteria.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a recently developed medical imaging method which could enable fast neural imaging in the brain by recording the resistance changes which occur as ion channels open during neuronal depolarization. In published studies in animal models with intracranial electrodes, changes of 0.005 to 3{\%} have been reported but the amplitude of changes in the human is not known. The purpose of this work was to determine if resistance changes could be recorded non-invasively in humans during evoked activity which could form the basis for EIT of fast neural activity. Resistance was recorded with scalp electrodes during 2 Hz pattern visual evoked responses over 10 min using an insensible 1 Hz square wave constant current of 0.1-1 mA. Significant resistance decreases of 0.0010 ± 0.0005{\%} (0.30 ± 0.15 $\mu$V, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2:1, n = 16 recordings over 6 subjects) (mean ± SE) were recorded. These are in broad agreement with modelling which estimated changes of 0.0039 ± 0.0034{\%} (1.03 ± 0.75 $\mu$V) using an anatomically realistic finite element model. This is the first demonstration of such changes in humans and so encourages the belief that EIT could be used for neural imaging. Unfortunately, the signal-to-noise ratio was not sufficient to permit imaging at present because recording over multiple injection sites needed for imaging would require impractically long recording times. However, in the future, invasive imaging with intracranial electrodes in animal models or humans and improved signal processing or recording may still enable imaging; this would constitute a significant advance in neuroscience technology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Background: A novel influenza virus has emerged to produce a global pandemic four times in the past one hundred years, resulting in millions of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. There is substantial uncertainty about when, where and how the next influenza pandemic will occur. Methods: We developed a novel mathematical model to chart the evolution of an influenza pandemic. We estimate the likely burden of future influenza pandemics through health and economic endpoints. An important component of this is the adequacy of existing hospital-resource capacity. Using a simulated population reflective of Ottawa, Using a simulated population reflective of Ottawa, Canada, we model the potential impact of a future influenza pandemic under different combinations of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Results: There was substantial variation in projected pandemic impact and outcomes across intervention scenarios. In a population of 1.2 million, the illness attack rate ranged from 8.4{\%} (all interventions) to 54.5{\%} (no interventions); peak acute care hospital capacity ranged from 0.2{\%} (all interventions) to 13.8{\%} (no interventions); peak ICU capacity ranged from 1.1{\%} (all interventions) to 90.2{\%} (no interventions); and mortality ranged from 11 (all interventions) to 363 deaths (no interventions). Associated estimates of economic burden ranged from CAD {\$}115 million to over {\$}2 billion when extended mass school closure was implemented. Discussion: Children accounted for a disproportionate number of pandemic infections, particularly in household settings. Pharmaceutical interventions effectively reduced peak and total pandemic burden without affecting timing, while non-pharmaceutical measures delayed and attenuated pandemic wave progression. The timely implementation of a layered intervention bundle appeared likely to protect hospital resource adequacy in Ottawa. The adaptable nature of this model provides value in informing pandemic preparedness policy planning in situations of uncertainty, as scenarios can be updated in real time as more data become available. However - given the inherent uncertainties of model assumptions - results should be interpreted with caution.},

Due to technical challenges, the neural mechanisms underlying such movements have not been previously studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this study, we present a novel treadmill device employed to investigate the kinematics and the brain activation patterns involved in alternating and repetitive movements of the lower limbs. Once inside the scanner, 19 healthy subjects were guided by two visual cues and instructed to perform a motor task which involved repetitive and alternating movements of both lower limbs while selecting their individual comfortable amplitude on the treadmill. The device facilitated the performance of coordinated stepping while registering the concurrent lower-limb displacements, which allowed us to quantify some movement primary kinematic features such as amplitude and frequency. During stepping, significant blood oxygen level dependent signal increases were observed bilaterally in primary and secondary sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobules, putamen and cerebellum, regions that are known to be involved in lower limb motor control. Brain activations related to individual adjustments during motor performance were identified in a right lateralized network including striatal, extrastriatal, and fronto-parietal areas.},

The generalized Tikhonov regularization methods have been popular in the solution of many inverse problems. The regularization matrices that are usually used with the Tikhonov method are more or less ad hoc and the implicit prior assumptions are, thus, in many cases inappropriate. In this paper, we propose an approach to the construction of the regularization matrix that conforms to the prior assumptions on the impedance distribution. The approach is based on the construction of an approximating subspace for the expected impedance distributions. It is shown by simulations that the reconstructions obtained with the proposed method are better than with two other schemes of the same type when the prior is compatible with the true object. On the other hand, when the prior is incompatible with the true object, the method will still give reasonable estimates.},

In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells. Through real-time imaging of STAP cells derived from purified lymphocytes, as well as gene rearrangement analysis, we found that committed somatic cells give rise to STAP cells by reprogramming rather than selection. STAP cells showed a substantial decrease in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of pluripotency marker genes. Blastocyst injection showed that STAP cells efficiently contribute to chimaeric embryos and to offspring via germline transmission. We also demonstrate the derivation of robustly expandable pluripotent cell lines from STAP cells. Thus, our findings indicate that epigenetic fate determination of mammalian cells can be markedly converted in a context-dependent manner by strong environmental cues.},

abstract = {We report the development of a new multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system called the KHU Mark2. It is descended from the KHU Mark1 in terms of technical details such as digital waveform generation, Howland current source with multiple generalized impedance converters and digital phase-sensitive demodulators. New features include flexible electrode configurations to accommodate application-specific requirements, multiple independent current sources and voltmeters for fully parallel operations, improved data acquisition speeds for faster frame rates and compact mechanical design. Given an electrode configuration, we can design an analog backplane in such a way that both current injections and voltage measurements can be done without using any switch. The KHU Mark2 is based on an impedance measurement module (IMM) comprising a current source and a voltmeter. Using multiple IMMs, we can construct a multi-channel system with 16, 32 or 64 channels, for example. Adopting a pipeline structure, it has the maximum data acquisition speed of 100 scans s(-1) with the potential to detect fast physiological changes during respiration and cardiac activity. Measuring both in-phase and quadrature components of trans-impedances at multiple frequencies simultaneously, the KHU Mark2 is apt at spectroscopic EIT imaging. In this paper, we describe its design, construction, calibration and performance evaluation. It has about 84 dB signal-to-noise ratio and 0.5{\%} reciprocity error. Time-difference images of an admittivity phantom are presented showing spectroscopic admittivity images. Future application studies using the KHU Mark2 are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Background: We investigated the effect of longitudinal status change in metabolic syndrome (MetS) assessed by two different criteria on new onset of type 2 diabetes (NODM) in a Japanese population. Methods: The participants were 827 non-diabetic citizens who had undergone medical examinations in 1994 and 2003 or 2004. We used two different criteria of MetS: the interim criteria by 6 institutions (MetS-INT) and Japanese criteria (MetS-JP). According to the interim criteria, individuals defined as having MetS have any three of the following five components of MetS: obesity, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholester-olemia. According to the Japanese criteria, individuals defined as having MetS must have abdominal obesity plus any two of the following three factors; hyperglycemia, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and/ or low HDL-cholesterolemia). According to the status change in MetS, participants were divided into four groups: a non-MetS to non-MetS group, a non-MetS to MetS group, a MetS to non-MetS group and a MetS to MetS group. We calculated odds ratios of these four groups for NODM. Results: NODM occurred in 65 participants. The odds ratios for NODM were 4.86, 4.97 and 7.50 in the non-MetS-INT to MetS-INT group, MetS-INT to non-MetS-INT group and MetS-INT to MetS-INT group, respectively. On the other hand, the odds ratios were 4.28 and 15.55 in the non-MetS-JP to MetS-JP group and MetS-JP to MetS-JP group, respectively. After adjustment for high fasting plasma glucose at baseline, magnitude of the odds ratio of MetS to MetS group was larger in the Japanese criteria group than in the interim criteria group. Conclusions: Determining the status of MetS routinely and paying attention to status change in MetS may be important for prevention of type 2 diabetes. MetS defined by the criteria which includes obesity as a prerequisite component may be a stronger risk for type 2 diabetes than MetS defined by the criteria which includes obesity as one of components.},

@article{Krauchi2005,
abstract = {The purpose of our study was to understand the relationship between the components of the three-process model of sleepiness regulation (homeostatic, circadian, and sleep inertia) and the thermoregulatory system. This was achieved by comparing the impact of a 40-h sleep deprivation vs. a 40-h multiple nap paradigm (10 cycles with 150/75 min wakefulness/sleep episodes) on distal and proximal skin temperatures, core body temperature (CBT), melatonin secretion, subjective sleepiness, and nocturnal sleep EEG slow-wave activity in eight healthy young men in a "controlled posture" protocol. The main finding of the study was that accumulation of sleep pressure increased subjective sleepiness and slow-wave activity during the succeeding recovery night but did not influence the thermoregulatory system as measured by distal, proximal, and CBT. The circadian rhythm of sleepiness (and proximal temperature) was significantly correlated and phase locked with CBT, whereas distal temperature and melatonin secretion were phase advanced (by 113 +/- 28 and 130 +/- 30 min, respectively; both P {\textless} 0.005). This provides evidence for a primary role of distal vasodilatation in the circadian regulation of CBT and its relationship with sleepiness. Specific thermoregulatory changes occur at lights off and on. After lights off, skin temperatures increased and were most pronounced for distal; after lights on, the converse occurred. The decay in distal temperature (vasoconstriction) was significantly correlated with the disappearance of sleep inertia. These effects showed minor and nonsignificant circadian modulation. In summary, the thermoregulatory system seems to be independent of the sleep homeostat, but the circadian modulation of sleepiness and sleep inertia is clearly associated with thermoregulatory changes.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop a method by which studies reporting the ranges (or maxima and minima) of observed outcomes can be included in systematic reviews, along with other studies reporting in the more usual way by using standard deviations (SDs). Study Design and Setting: An approach is proposed to allow a numerical conversion of a reported range from a continuous outcome into an equivalent SD. Results: The SD is estimated from the observed range times an appropriate conversion factor. Two examples (the first concerning a patient education program on adherence to drug treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and the second investigating if cognitive behavior therapy could improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and then lead to suppression of human immunodeficiency virus replication) demonstrate the calculations. Conclusion: This note provides a simple method to allow studies that report outcome variability in terms of ranges to be included in systematic reviews by conversion to equivalent SDs. The method is entirely valid if the outcome variable is normally distributed, but for nonnormal data, some caution may be needed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ethical debate The dilemma of the incapacitated patient who has previously refused consent for surgery What should doctors do if a patient is critically ill and unable to give consent to a procedure that he or she has previously refused to consent to? Such a case is described below and discussed by a medicolegal specialist and by an ethicist. A 72 year old Italian woman who spoke little English was admitted to hospital with a minor haemoptysis. Her medical history was complex. She had asthma, oesophageal varices, and recurrent small pulmonary embolisms, and had undergone partial thyroidectomy for a multinodular goitre. Her medication included salbutamol, ipratropium, becotide, warfarin, and thyroxine. Physical examination showed that the patient weighed 105 kg and had a large neck swelling that extended retrosternally. Her condition was otherwise stable. A provisional diagnosis of minor pulmonary embolism was made, and the patient was given treatment to relieve symptoms overnight. The follow-ing morning she had an acute upper airway obstruction as a result of haemoptysis. She was resus-citated by the cardiac arrest team, intubated and venti-lated, and was then transferred to the intensive care unit, where her condition was stabilised and she was sedated. Bronchoscopy showed external tracheal compression with contact bleeding of the mucosa. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that she had a large neck swelling (10 cm × 8 cm), which was probably a thyroid goitre. It extended from the mandible to the carina and encased all the major mediastinal blood vessels in its path. It was concluded that acute bleeding into the goitre caused upper airway obstruction and that the haemoptysis resulted from erosion of the tracheal wall.},

abstract = {A cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which occur together more often than by chance alone, have become known as the metabolic syndrome. The risk factors include raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia (raised triglycerides and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), raised fasting glucose, and central obesity. Various diagnostic criteria have been proposed by different organizations over the past decade. Most recently, these have come from the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The main difference concerns the measure for central obesity, with this being an obligatory component in the International Diabetes Federation definition, lower than in the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria, and ethnic specific. The present article represents the outcome of a meeting between several major organizations in an attempt to unify criteria. It was agreed that there should not be an obligatory component, but that waist measurement would continue to be a useful preliminary screening tool. Three abnormal findings out of 5 would qualify a person for the metabolic syndrome. A single set of cut points would be used for all components except waist circumference, for which further work is required. In the interim, national or regional cut points for waist circumference can be used.},

This study evaluated the potential associations between vitamin A intake and several anthropometrical, biochemical and dietary features in healthy young adults, emphasizing the putative relationships between total antioxidant consumption and vitamin A intake. This translational research enrolled 61 healthy young adults aged 18-22 y. Anthropometrical and blood pressure measurements, blood samples and nutritional intake data were collected. After adjusting for total energy intake, vitamin A intake showed a negative correlation with several adiposity measurements. Furthermore, vitamin A consumption was positively associated with serum total cholesterol as well as with the intake of antioxidant foodstuffs. So, vitamin A intake seems to be related, not only with the total antioxidant intake, but also with several anthropometrical and biochemical measurements linked to metabolic syndrome manifestations and other features related to oxidative stress in healthy young adults.},

abstract = {The intermediate-band solar cell (IBSC) with quantum dots and a bulk semiconductor matrix has potential for high power conversion efficiency, exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit. However, the IBSCs reported to date have been fabricated only by dry process and their efficiencies are limited, because their photo-absorption layers have low particle density of quantum dots, defects due to lattice strain, and low bandgap energy of bulk semiconductors. Here we present solution-processed IBSCs containing photo-absorption layers where lead sulfide quantum dots are densely dispersed in methylammonium lead bromide perovskite matrices with a high bandgap energy of 2.3 eV under undistorted conditions. We confirm that the present IBSCs exhibit two-step photon absorption via intermediate-band at room temperature by inter-subband photocurrent spectroscopy.},

abstract = {A meta-analysis is a quantitative synthesis of randomised clinical trials, used to evaluate moderate treatment effects in oncology. It is complementary to large-scale trials. We describes the principles, methods, and limits of meta-analyses. The gold standard for a meta-analysis is to obtain individual patient data directly from each principal investigator, but this is time-consuming and costly. The main steps of a meta-analysis using individual patient data are described. Multidisciplinary collaboration is needed for clinical insight and critical review of the data and results. Meta-analysis should include an evaluation of the trial quality, a quantification of the overall treatment effect, a study of the variations seen in this effect between trials, and pre-planned exploratory analyses to identify groups of patients who may benefit more from the treatment. Statistical methods are explained using real working examples. Since literature-based meta-analysis can lead to seriously biased assessments, meta-analyses of individual patient data should be undertaken systematically when long-term follow-up is needed, when a detailed analysis is important, or when the literature-based meta-analyses are not in agreement. The main factors which influence the quality of a meta-analysis are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Similar to the healthcare systems in other industrialized countries, the Japanese healthcare system is facing the problem of increasing medical expenditure. In Japan, this situation may be primarily attributed to advanced technological developments, an aging population, and increasing patient demand. Japan also faces the problem of a declining youth population due to a low birth rate. Taken together, these problems present the healthcare system with a very difficult financial situation. Several reforms have been undertaken to contain medical expenditure, such as increasing employee copayment for health insurance from 10{\%} to 20{\%} in 1997 and from 20{\%} to 30{\%} in 2003 in order to curb unnecessary visits to medical institutions. Since the aging of the Japanese population is inevitable, a suitable method to contain medical expenditure may be to screen individuals who are likely to develop lifestyle-related diseases and conduct early intervention programs for them to prevent the development of diseases such as myocardial infarction or stroke that are costly to treat. If this goal is attained, it may contribute to the containment of medical expenditure as well as to improving the quality of life of the elderly. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has decided to introduce a nationwide health screening and intervention program specifically targeting the metabolic syndrome commencing April 2008. Here, we discuss (1) the background of the Japanese healthcare system and the problems facing it, (2) the underlying objective and details of the new screening program, and (3) the expected impact of the program.},

abstract = {Background: Despite effective assessment methods and medications targeting osteoporosis and related fractures, screening for fracture risk is not currently advocated in the UK. We tested whether a community-based screening intervention could reduce fractures in older women. Methods: We did a two-arm randomised controlled trial in women aged 70-85 years to compare a screening programme using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) with usual management. Women were recruited from 100 general practitioner (GP) practices in seven regions of the UK: Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. We excluded women who were currently on prescription anti-osteoporotic drugs and any individuals deemed to be unsuitable to enter a research study (eg, known dementia, terminally ill, or recently bereaved). The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals who had one or more osteoporosis-related fractures over a 5-year period. In the screening group, treatment was recommended in women identified to be at high risk of hip fracture, according to the FRAX 10-year hip fracture probability. Prespecified secondary outcomes were the proportions of participants who had at least one hip fracture, any clinical fracture, or mortality; and the effect of screening on anxiety and health-related quality of life. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, number ISRCTN 55814835. Findings: 12 483 eligible women were identified and participated in the trial, and 6233 women randomly assigned to the screening group between April 15, 2008, and July 2, 2009. Treatment was recommended in 898 (14{\%}) of 6233 women. Use of osteoporosis medication was higher at the end of year 1 in the screening group compared with controls (15{\%} vs 4{\%}), with uptake particularly high (78{\%} at 6 months) in the screening high-risk subgroup. Screening did not reduce the primary outcome of incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures (hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}94, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}85-1{\textperiodcentered}03, p=0{\textperiodcentered}178), nor the overall incidence of all clinical fractures (0{\textperiodcentered}94, 0{\textperiodcentered}86-1{\textperiodcentered}03, p=0{\textperiodcentered}183), but screening reduced the incidence of hip fractures (0{\textperiodcentered}72, 0{\textperiodcentered}59-0{\textperiodcentered}89, p=0{\textperiodcentered}002). There was no evidence of differences in mortality, anxiety levels, or quality of life. Interpretation: Systematic, community-based screening programme of fracture risk in older women in the UK is feasible, and could be effective in reducing hip fractures.

abstract = {Intra-abdominal fat is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. Levels of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP4), secreted by fat and liver cells, are increased in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we report that, in 196 subjects, RBP4 is preferentially expressed in visceral (Vis) versus subcutaneous (SC) fat. Vis fat RBP4 mRNA was increased approximately 60-fold and 12-fold in Vis and SC obese subjects respectively versus lean subjects, and approximately 2-fold with impaired glucose tolerance/T2D subjects versus normoglycemic subjects. In obese subjects, serum RBP4 was increased 2- to 3-fold, and serum transthyretin, which stabilizes RBP4 in the circulation, was increased 35{\%}. Serum RBP4 correlated positively with adipose RBP4 mRNA and intra-abdominal fat mass and inversely with insulin sensitivity, independently of age, gender, and body mass index. RBP4 mRNA correlated inversely with GLUT4 mRNA in Vis fat and positively with adipocyte size in both depots. RBP4 levels are therefore linked to Vis adiposity, and Vis fat may be a major source of RBP4 in insulin-resistant states.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In meta-analyses of clinical trials, clinicians are often interested in examining subset effects. Meta-regression of aggregated data is a usual approach for relating sources of variation in treatment effects to specific study characteristics. However, it is known that study-level analyses can lead to biased assessments and have some limitations in explaining the heterogeneity. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis offers several advantages for this purpose.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We compared some regression analyses of IPD with meta-regression analyses of the summarized data using a real-world example in order to investigate whether a binary patient characteristic is related to treatment effect. We used data from 10 randomized trials for non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 1355).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For treatment x stage interaction in IPD regression analysis, none of the tests of interactions was statistically significant. The meta-regression analysis gave a greater P-value than the IPD analysis. When excluding two studies, which had only stage I patients, the interaction was also not statistically significant in IPD analysis. On the other hand, the result of meta-regression analysis, though also showing no significant relationship, revealed a clear reversal in the direction of effect.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We suggest that the results of meta-regression analyses would not be as robust as those of regression analyses using IPD in examining potential modifiers of treatment effects. To investigate whether patient characteristics are related to treatment effects, we suggest that interaction tests and sensitivity analyses using IPD should be employed whenever possible.},

abstract = {In population studies, higher blood pressure has been associated with lower intake of protein and, possibly, lower fiber consumption. In the present randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether dietary protein and fiber had additive effects on blood pressure reduction in hypertensives. Treated hypertensive patients changed for 4 weeks (familiarization) to a diet low in protein (12.5{\%} energy) and fiber (15 g/d). Patients (n=41) were then randomized to 1 of 4 groups in an 8-week factorial study of parallel design in which they continued the low-protein, low-fiber diet alone or had supplements of soy protein to increase protein intake to 25{\%} energy, of psyllium to provide an additional 12 g soluble fiber/d, or of both protein and fiber. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure was compared from the end of familiarization to the end of intervention. In the 36 subjects who provided complete data, protein and fiber had significant additive effects to lower 24-hour and awake systolic blood pressure. Relative to control subjects, the net reduction in 24-hour systolic blood pressure was 5.9 mm Hg with fiber and with protein. Findings were independent of age, gender, and change in weight, alcohol intake, or urinary sodium and potassium. Relative to reduced fiber and protein intake, dietary protein and soluble fiber supplements lower blood pressure additively in hypertensives. These findings have important implications for the prevention and management of hypertension, particularly in populations in which high blood pressure is prevalent in association with diets low in protein, fiber, or both.},

abstract = {1. Analysis of the activity of single neurones in the gustatory pathways in primates (cynomolgus monkeys) shows that the tuning of neurones to the four prototypical stimuli 1.0 mol l-1 glucose, 1.0 mol l-1 NaCl, 0.001 mol l-1 quinine-HCl and 0.01 mol l-1 HCl becomes sharper as information progresses through the taste system from the first central relay in the brainstem, the nucleus of the solitary tract, via the thalamus to the primary taste cortex in the frontal operculum and insula to reach a secondary cortical taste area in the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex. 2. Feeding monkeys to satiety with glucose has no effect on the gustatory responses of neurones in the nucleus of the solitary tract, the frontal opercular taste cortex or the insular taste cortex, but decreases the magnitude of the neuronal responses of orbitofrontal cortex taste neurones which respond to glucose to zero. 3. The responses of orbitofrontal cortex taste neurones decrease to foods on which the monkey is fed to satiety, but continue to foods which have not just been eaten, that is, they reflect sensory-specific satiety, the phenomenon in which the pleasantness of the taste of a food and its acceptability, but not those of of other foods, is decreased by eating that food to satiety. 4. It has been found that the orbitofrontal cortex taste area or areas receives inputs from different modalities: single neurones with unimodal responses to taste (47{\%}), olfactory (12{\%}) and visual (10{\%}) stimuli are found in close proximity to each other. Moreover, some single neurones show multimodal convergence, responding, for example, to taste and visual inputs (17{\%}), taste and olfactory inputs (10{\%}), and olfactory and visual inputs (4{\%}). Some of these multimodal single neurones have corresponding sensitivities in the two modalities: they respond best to sweet tastes (e.g. 1 mol l-1 glucose), and respond more in a visual discrimination task to the visual stimulus which signifies sweet fruit juice than to that which signifies saline; or they respond to sweet taste and, in an olfactory discrimination task, to fruit juice odour. These results suggest that multimodal representations are formed in the orbitofrontal cortex secondary and related taste areas.},

Functional chest examinations with this technology are considered clinically relevant, especially for monitoring regional lung ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients and for regional pulmonary function testing in patients with chronic lung diseases. As EIT becomes an established medical technology, it requires consensus examination, nomenclature, data analysis and interpretation schemes. Such consensus is needed to compare, understand and reproduce study findings from and among different research groups, to enable large clinical trials and, ultimately, routine clinical use. Recommendations of how EIT findings can be applied to generate diagnoses and impact clinical decision-making and therapy planning are required. This consensus paper was prepared by an international working group, collaborating on the clinical promotion of EIT called TRanslational EIT developmeNt stuDy group. It addresses the stated needs by providing (1) a new classification of core processes involved in chest EIT examinations and data analysis, (2) focus on clinical applications with structured reviews and outlooks (separately for adult and neonatal/paediatric patients), (3) a structured framework to categorise and understand the relationships among analysis approaches and their clinical roles, (4) consensus, unified terminology with clinical user-friendly definitions and explanations, (5) a review of all major work in thoracic EIT and (6) recommendations for future development (193 pages of online supplements systematically linked with the chief sections of the main document).

abstract = {A stochastic infectious disease model was developed by Ball (1986, Advances in Applied Probability 18, 289-310) in which the distribution of the length of the infectious period is allowed to have any distribution that can be described by its Laplace transform. We extend this model such that the infection can be transmitted within the population or from an unspecified source outside the population. Also, discrete heterogeneity in the population can be modeled to incorporate variable susceptibility, variable infectivity, and/or mixing behaviors. The model is fitted to serologic data from two influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan, using maximum likelihood estimation procedures. The estimates show a clustering pattern by age groups.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography is a noninvasive and cost-effective
imaging method that is increasingly attractive in the field of medical
diagnostics. Several health conditions, such as stroke and solid tumors,
are characterized by compact conductivity anomalies surrounded by a
fairly regular background. Commonly employed voxel-by-voxel
reconstruction methods for impedance imaging share the disadvantages of
high computational cost and substantial sensitivity to measurement noise
and imperfections in the electrical model describing the domain of
interest. We present a special purpose algorithm for automatic detection
and identification of compact conductivity variations. The technique
exploits a priori structural information and, by reconstructing only the
limited number of parameters required to describe a compact conductivity
contrast, does not depend on a critical regularization parameter. The
most demanding kernels are implemented to run on graphics processing
units to accelerate computation. The parametric reconstruction is
quicker and more robust than widely employed approaches with respect to
measurement noise and imperfections in the electrical model, as shown by
computational analysis performed on a segmented head domain and
experimental measurements acquired on a cylindrical phantom. When the
goal is quick detection of compact conductivity contrasts in complex 3-D
domains, the inclusion of specific constraints relating to the problem
considered leads to enhanced quality of reconstruction, making the
presented technique a promising alternative to common voxel-by-voxel
reconstruction methods.},

abstract = {To design a consumer-oriented package that complements the taste and aroma of ready-to-drink chilled-cup coffee beverages by using the food kansei model, the effects of the diameter and the color of drinking straws as well as the cognition terms of coffee on consumer sensory characteristics and preferences were investigated. Variance and factor analyses of the sensory scores for chilled-cup coffee with milk and sugar using straws of different diameters, as rated by consumer panelists, extracted two perceived factors (F1, contribution ratio 36.5{\%}, and F2, 28.6{\%}). A two-dimensional plot of the average F1 and F2 scores of 123 panelists showed that the perceived characteristics of the same taste and aroma varied according to the straw diameter. An image investigation of different straw colors and another sensory evaluation using “black,” “brown,” and “green” straws were also performed. A principal component analysis of the image data revealed that the sensory characteristics of coffee with milk and sugar were imaged from the straw color. The second evaluation suggested that the images of straw colors affected the sensory characteristics. In addition, cluster and multiple-comparison analyses of Internet research data from consumers regarding the cognition terms for coffee exhibited three clusters representing the cognitive characteristics of terms by consumers and by developers and the differences of attractiveness degree on the cognition terms due to the consumers' personal attributes. These studies provide useful information for the development of packages of chilled-cup coffee beverages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Among adults, obesity has been positively related to bone mineral density. However, recent findings have pointed out that abdominal obesity could be negatively related to bone density. The above mentioned relationship is not clear among pediatric populations. Therefore, this cross-sectional study analyzed the relationship between thickness of abdominal adipose tissue and bone mineral variables in sedentary obese children and adolescents. METHODS One hundred and seventy five obese children and adolescents (83 male and 92 female) with ages ranging from 6 to 16 years-old were analyzed. Bone mineral content and density were estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and ultrasound equipment which estimated the thickness of the abdominal adipose tissue. Pubertal stage was self-reported by the participants. RESULTS The mean age was 11.1 (SD=2.6). Thickness of the abdominal adipose tissue was negatively related to bone mineral density (r=-0.17 [r95{\%}CI: -0.03;-0.32]), independent of gender, pubertal stage and other confounders ($\beta$=-0.134±0.042 [$\beta$95{\%}CI: -0.217; -0.050]). CONCLUSIONS In sedentary obese children and adolescents abdominal obesity is negatively related to bone mineral density, suggesting a potential link between abdominal obesity and osteoporosis.},

The subjects did not take estrogen replacement therapy; supplements of vitamins, minerals, and phytoestrogens; or other medications known to affect bone and lipid metabolism. The study consisted of 2 intervention periods of 2 mo each, during which women drank 1 L/d of a control mineral water (low mineral content) for 2 mo followed by the carbonated mineral water, rich in sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride, for 2 mo. Body weight, height, and blood pressure were measured, and BMI was calculated. Blood samples were taken from fasting subjects and serum was analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein B, soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and glucose.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The relationship between excess abdominal adipose tissue, metabolic and cardiovascular health risk has stimulated interest in the efficacy of physical activity in specifically perturbing this adipose depot. The evolution of imaging techniques has enabled more direct measurement of changes in abdominal and visceral fat. The purpose of this summary was to systematically review the relationship between physical activity and abdominal fat. METHODS: Database searches were performed on MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORT DISCUS and PUBMED, from 1985 to 2005 with keywords "exercise", "abdominal fat" and "visceral fat". RESULTS: Nineteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight non-randomized controlled trials were selected. In RCTs using imaging techniques to measure change in abdominal fat in overweight or obese subjects, seven out of 10 studies (including three trials with type 2 diabetics) reported significant reductions compared with controls. Reductions in visceral and total abdominal fat may occur in the absence of changes in body mass and waist circumference. Waist-to-hip ratio is not a sensitive measure of change in regional adiposity in exercise studies. No studies fulfil the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement's criteria for the highest quality of randomized trial; however, many studies were in progress or published before the opportunity to comply with these recommendations. Therefore, limited evidence from a number of studies suggests a beneficial influence of physical activity on reduction in abdominal and visceral fat in overweight and obese subjects when imaging techniques are used to quantify changes in abdominal adiposity. More rigorous studies are needed to confirm these observations.},

Nineteen fasted adult women (mean age: 39.2??0.7 years, mean BMI: 26.1??0.8kg/m2) consumed test foods including dried plums, low-fat cookies, white bread and water only on separate days. The test foods (with the exception of water) provided 238kcal and were similar in total carbohydrate, fat and protein content but differed in fiber and sugar content. Subjects rated their feelings of hunger using satiety index scales prior to snack consumption and again every 15min for 2h following initiation of intake. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120min following intake. At the end of the 120-min test period, subjects were presented with a meal to be consumed until satisfied. The satiety index AUC was greater for the dried plum trial versus the low-fat cookie trial (p???0.05). There was no difference in post-snack consumption between the dried plums and cookie trials. The dried plums trial elicited lower plasma glucose and insulin AUC than the low-fat cookie trial (p???0.05) and tended to promote a greater plasma ghrelin AOC (p=0.056). These results demonstrate that consuming dried plums as a snack suppresses hunger relative to a low-fat cookie as evidenced by lower glucose and/or satiety-regulating hormone concentrations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Obesity has been associated with alterations in plasma steroid hormone concentrations in men. Older men present an altered steroid hormone profile compared to younger individuals, and an increase in body fatness and changes in adipose tissue (AT) distribution are noted with advancing age. Thus, there is a need to examine the relative importance of increased body fatness and changes in AT distribution with advancing age to plasma steroid hormone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels in men. We, therefore, investigated the relationships among age, body fatness, AT distribution, and the plasma steroid hormone profile in a group of 217 Caucasian men (mean age +/- SD, 36.2 +/- 14.9 yr) who covered a wide age range (17-64 yr). Compared to young adult men, older men were characterized by increased adiposity (P {\textless} 0.0001) expressed either as body mass index or total body fat mass assessed by underwater weighing. Differences in AT distribution were also noted with a preferential accumulation of abdominal fat as indicated by a larger waist girth (P {\textless} 0.0001) and higher visceral AT accumulation (P {\textless} 0.0001), measured by computed tomography, in older subjects. Age was associated with decreases (P {\textless} 0.0001) in C19 adrenal steroid levels, namely reduced dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA fatty acid ester, DHEA sulfate, as well as androstenedione levels. Androgens, i.e. dihydrotestosterone and testosterone, were also affected by age, with lower levels of both steroids being found in older individuals (P {\textless} 0.0005). When statistical adjustment for body fatness and AT distribution was performed, differences in C19 adrenal steroids between the age groups remained significant, whereas differences in androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations were no longer significant. The present study suggests that age-related differences in plasma steroid hormone levels, especially androgens, are partly mediated by concomitant variation in adiposity in men.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that propensity for weight gain, energy balance state and sex are important determinants of the neuronal response to visual food cues. It is not clear, though, whether these factors also impact the neuronal response to taste. The objective of this study was to examine the neuronal response to sweet taste during energy imbalance in men and women recruited to be obesity-prone (OP) or obesity-resistant (OR). OP (13 men and 12 women) and OR (12 men and 12 women) subjects were studied after 1 day of eucaloric, overfed and underfed conditions in a randomized crossover design. On each test day, fMRI was performed in the respective acute fed state while subjects received in random order 60 trials each of 1. M sucrose solution (SU), or artificial saliva (AS) following a visual cue predicting the taste. The neuronal response to SU versus AS expectation was significantly greater in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, putamen and insula in OR versus OP; SU receipt was not different between groups. There were also sex-based differences with men having greater neuronal response to SU versus AS receipt in the caudate than women. The results, however, were not impacted by the state of energy balance. In summary, response to expectation but not receipt of basic sweet taste was different in OR compared to OP, highlighting the importance of learning and conditioning in the propensity to gain weight. Response to sucrose taste receipt was stronger in men than women, raising questions about the effect of sex hormones on brain response to food.},

abstract = {People in Japan have the longest life expectancy at birth in the world. Here, we compile the best available evidence about population health in Japan to investigate what has made the Japanese people healthy in the past 50 years. The Japanese population achieved longevity in a fairly short time through a rapid reduction in mortality rates for communicable diseases from the 1950s to the early 1960s, followed by a large reduction in stroke mortality rates. Japan had moderate mortality rates for non-communicable diseases, with the exception of stroke, in the 1950s. The improvement in population health continued after the mid-1960s through the implementation of primary and secondary preventive community public health measures for adult mortality from non-communicable diseases and an increased use of advanced medical technologies through the universal insurance scheme. Reduction in health inequalities with improved average population health was partly attributable to equal educational opportunities and financial access to care. With the achievement of success during the health transition since World War 2, Japan now needs to tackle major health challenges that are emanating from a rapidly ageing population, causes that are not amenable to health technologies, and the effects of increasing social disparities to sustain the improvement in population health. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Humans with bilateral damage to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, or the amygdala, are deficient in their ability to use information about positive and negative outcomes to guide their choice behavior. Similarly, rats and monkeys with orbital prefrontal or amygdala damage have been found to be impaired in their responses to changing values of outcomes. In the present study, we tested whether direct, functional interaction between the amygdala and the orbital prefrontal cortex is necessary for guiding behavior based on expected outcomes. Unlike control monkeys, rhesus monkeys with surgical disconnection of these two structures, achieved by crossed unilateral lesions of the amygdala in one hemisphere and orbital prefrontal cortex in the other, combined with forebrain commissurotomy, were unable to adjust their choice behavior after a change in the outcome (here, a reduction in the value of a particular reinforcer). The lesions did not affect motivation to work for a food reinforcer, or food preferences, per se. Hence, the amygdala and orbital prefrontal cortex act as part of an integrated neural system guiding decision-making and adaptive response selection.},

Groups that were more likely to have MetS included women (OR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.10), Hispanics (OR, 1.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.23), individuals with Medicare (OR, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.33-1.42), and those with Medicaid (OR, 1.68; 95{\%} CI, 1.58-1.78) compared with men, whites, and those with commercial insurance, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: We excluded individuals with missing data for any of the conditions that define MetS, which may underestimate the actual prevalence of this condition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The considerable prevalence of MetS in our North Carolina sample suggests that interventions are needed to achieve the state's population health goals.},

abstract = {The protective mechanisms by which some obese individuals escape the detrimental metabolic consequences of obesity are not understood. This study examined differences in body fat distribution and adipocytokines in obese older persons with and without metabolic syndrome. Additionally, we examined whether adipocytokines mediate the association between body fat distribution and metabolic syndrome. Data were from 729 obese men and women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)), aged 70-79 participating in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. Thirty-one percent of these obese men and women did not have metabolic syndrome. Obese persons with metabolic syndrome had significantly more abdominal visceral fat (men: P = 0.04; women: P {\textless} 0.01) and less thigh subcutaneous fat (men: P = 0.09; women: P {\textless} 0.01) than those without metabolic syndrome. Additionally, those with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) than individuals without metabolic syndrome. Per standard deviation higher in visceral fat, the likelihood of metabolic syndrome significantly increased in women (odds ratio (OR): 2.16, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.59-2.94). In contrast, the likelihood of metabolic syndrome decreased in both men (OR: 0.56, 95{\%} CI: 0.39-0.80) and women (OR: 0.49, 95{\%} CI: 0.34-0.69) with each standard deviation higher in thigh subcutaneous fat. These associations were partly mediated by adipocytokines; the association between thigh subcutaneous fat and metabolic syndrome was no longer significant in men. In summary, metabolically healthy obese older persons had a more favorable fat distribution, characterized by lower visceral fat and greater thigh subcutaneous fat and a more favorable inflammatory profile compared to their metabolically unhealthy obese counterparts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) involves a substantial amount of energy expenditure in humans and, thus, contributes to reducing the risk for obesity. Molecular evolutionary studies have reported that SNPs in/near the uncoupling protein 3 gene (UCP3) and the regulatory associated protein of mTOR complex 1 gene (RPTOR) might influence NST and confer adaptive advantages for modern human dispersal into cold environments. In the present study, the impact of these SNPs on obesity-related traits was investigated. METHODS: Study subjects consisted of 2,834 Japanese adults (percentage of female: 46{\%}, mean age: 51.5). Associations of the UCP3-55C/T and the RPTOR-26934C/T - the 2 potential genetic variations involved in cold adaptation and thermogenic mechanisms in mammals, with quantitative obesity-related traits including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, visceral fat area (VFA), VFA adjusted for BMI, and selected blood parameters - were tested using multiple linear regression models. Sliding windowsampling analysis was applied to depict seasonal effects of the SNPs on the obesity-related phenotypes. RESULTS: UCP3-55C/T and the RPTOR-26934C/T did not show any association with obesity traits and blood chemical parameters in multiple linear regression models consisting of the whole subjects. Moreover, sliding window sampling-based association analyses involving seasonality also failed to find associations between these two SNPs and obesity-related traits. CONCLUSIONS: UCP3-55C/T and the RPTOR-26934C/T may only have subtle effects on the development of obesity-related traits in the present humans. These two SNPs might be irrelevant to inter-individual variations in energy metabolism and efficiency of NST.},

Before and after the intervention, CIT (the increase in resting metabolic rate at 16°C relative to 22°C) was measured by a ventilated hood indirect calorimeter, whereas DIT was measured as the 24-h thermic response to 1 day of 50{\%} overfeeding (TEF150{\%} ) in a respiratory chamber.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: After the cold intervention, CIT more than doubled from 5.2{\%} ± 14.2{\%} at baseline to 12.0{\%} ± 11.1{\%} (P = 0.05), in parallel with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.

abstract = {Previous Mediterranean diet scores were simple to apply but may not be appropriate for non-Mediterranean populations. We developed a Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS) to assess the conformity of an individual's diet to a traditional Mediterranean-style diet. The MSDPS is based on the recommended intakes of 13 food groups in the Mediterranean diet pyramid. Each food group is scored from 0 to 10 depending on the degree of correspondence with recommendations. Exceeding the recommendations results in a lower score proportional to the degree of overconsumption. The sum of the component scores is standardized to a 0-100 scale and weighted by the proportion of energy consumed from Mediterranean diet foods. We applied the MSDPS to dietary data collected at the 7th examination of the Framingham Offspring Cohort and tested the content validity of the score against selected nutrients known to be associated with the Mediterranean-style dietary pattern. The mean MSDPS was 24.8 (range, 3.1-60.7). Participants with a higher MSDPS were more likely to be women, older, multivitamin users, to have lower BMI and waist circumferences, and less likely to be current smokers. The MSDPS demonstrated content validity through expected positive associations with intakes of dietary fiber, (n-3) fatty acids, antioxidant vitamins, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, and inverse associations with those of added sugar, glycemic index, saturated fat, and trans-fat, and the (n-6):(n-3) fatty acid ratio. The MSDPS is a useful instrument to measure overall diet quality according to the principles of a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern.},

To determine the food sources of energy and 26 nutrients consumed by US adults the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 24-h recall (Day 1) dietary intake data from a nationally representative sample of adults 19+ years of age (y) (n = 9490) were analyzed. An updated USDA Dietary Source Nutrient Database was developed for NHANES 2003-2006 using current food composition databases. Food grouping included ingredients from disaggregated mixtures. Mean energy and nutrient intakes from food sources were sample-weighted. Percentages of total dietary intake contributed from food sources were ranked. The highest ranked sources of energy and nutrients among adults more than 19 years old were: energy - yeast bread/rolls (7.2{\%}) and cake/cookies/quick bread/pastry/pie (7.2{\%}); protein-poultry (14.4{\%}) and beef (14.0{\%}); total fat - other fats and oils (9.8{\%}); saturated fatty acids - cheese (16.5{\%}) and beef (9.1{\%}); carbohydrate - soft drinks/soda (11.4{\%}) and yeast breads/rolls (10.9{\%}); dietary fiber - yeast breads/rolls (10.9{\%}) and fruit (10.2{\%}); calcium - milk (22.5{\%}) and cheese (21.6{\%}); vitamin D - milk (45.1{\%}) and fish/shellfish (14.4{\%}); and potassium - milk (9.6{\%}) and coffee/tea/other non-alcoholic beverages (8.4{\%}). Knowledge of primary food sources of energy and nutrients can help health professionals design effective strategies to reduce excess energy consumed by US adults and increase the nutrient adequacy of their diets.},

abstract = {This study examines the influence of circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and serum leptin on bone mass as well as modulation of bone mass during skeletal development. Moreover, an inverse relationship between IGF-1 and leptin is reported. To evaluate the effects of serum IGF-1 and serum leptin on bone mass in healthy postmenopausal women, and the possible role of IGF-1 in leptin production, we studied a population of 123 women, aged 39-82 years. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by whole-body dual-energy X ray absorptiometry, which also enables measurement of body composition. Bone metabolism was assessed by measuring serum total alkaline phosphatase (TAP) and urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine (HP/Cr) excretion. IGF-1 correlated significantly with age (r = -0.28, p {\textless} 0.01) and years since menopause (r = -0.24, p {\textless} 0.01). A negative correlation was also found with weight and body mass index (r = -0.15, p {\textless} 0.05 and r = -0.19, p {\textless} 0.05, respectively). Leptin values were strongly correlated with weight (r = 0.7, p {\textless} 0.01), BMI (r = 0.7, p {\textless} 0.01), fat mass (r = 0.77, p {\textless} 0.01), and lean mass (r = 0.39, p {\textless} 0.01); a significant correlation was found with total body BMD (r = 0.29, p {\textless} 0.01), TAP (r = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.05), and HP/Cr (r = 0.18, p {\textless} 0.05). After adjustment for BMI, the significance of these relationships disappeared, demonstrating the lack of effect of serum leptin on BMD and bone turnover independent of body weight. On the other hand, the relationship between BMD and fat mass remained statistically significant after adjusting for serum leptin (r = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.05). Controlling for BMI eliminated the significant inverse correlation between IGF-1 and leptin; significant differences in leptin levels were found among women in the lower and higher quartile of IGF-1, suggesting that leptin production may be inhibited only at high values of serum IGF-1. We conclude that serum IGF-1 and serum leptin have no direct effect on bone mass and bone turnover.},

abstract = {Abstract: Alpha linolenic acid-enriched diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG) reduces visceral fat area and body fat in rodents and humans compared to conventional triacylglycerol (TAG). Although ALA-DAG increases dietary fat utilization as energy in rodents, its effects in humans are not known. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover intervention trial performed to clarify the effect of ALA-DAG on postprandial energy metabolism in humans. Nineteen healthy subjects participated in this study, and postprandial energy metabolism was evaluated using indirect calorimetry followed by 14-d repeated pre-consumption of TAG (rapeseed oil) as a control or ALA-DAG. As a primary outcome, ALA- DAG induced significantly higher postprandial fat oxidation than TAG. As a secondary outcome, carbohydrate oxidation tended to be decreased. In addition, postprandial energy expenditure was significantly increased by ALA-DAG compared to TAG. These findings suggest that daily ALA-DAG consumption stimulates dietary fat utilization as energy after a meal, as well as greater diet induced thermogenesis in healthy humans. In conclusion, repeated consumption of ALA-DAG enhanced postprandial fat metabolism after a meal, which may partially explain its visceral fat area-reducing effect. Key},

These markers form a new diagnosis tool "NAT" aiming at characterizing various brain disorders. Each signal sequence is divided into segments of 0.64 s and its discrete PS consists of eleven frequency components from 4.68 (3 × 1.56) Hz through 20.34 (13 × 1.56) Hz. PS is normalized to its mean and the bias of PS components on each frequency component across the 21 signal channels is reset to zero. The marker sNAT consists of ten frequency components on 21 channels, characterizing neuronal hyperactivity or hypoactivity as compared with NLc (normal controls). The marker vNAT consists of ten ratios between adjacent PS components denoting the over- or undersynchrony of collective neuronal activities as compared with NLc. The likelihood of a test subject to a specified brain disease is defined in terms of the normalized distance to the template NAT state of the disease in the NAT space. Separation of MCI-AD patients (developing AD in 12-18 months) from NLc is made with a false alarm rate of 15{\%}. Locations with neuronal hypoactivity and undersynchrony of AD patients agree with locations of rCBF reduction measured by SPECT. The 2-D diagram composed of the binary likelihoods between ADc and NLc in the two representations of sNAT and vNAT enables tracing the NAT state of a test subject approaching the AD area, and the follow-up of the treatment effects.},

abstract = {Studies of adducts from reactive compounds to haemoglobin (Hb) by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry according to the N-alkyl Edman method reveals the occurrence of N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)valine (diHOPrVal) at levels of 1-2 pmol/g Hb, in persons without known exposure. The hypothesis that this background originates from glycidol or related compounds during heating of food was tested in experiments with rats. Animals fed fried animal feed for 30 or 72 days showed an increase of the diHOPrVal level by about 50{\%} compared with controls. Several arguments, such as the formation of reactive oxiranes by heat-induced dehydration of glycol configurations in glycerol and sugars, support the idea that glycidol (or e.g. glycidyl esters) are precursors of the adduct. In Hb samples, reduced for stabilisation of aldehyde adducts, relatively high levels of adducts determined as diHOPrVal were found, although without significant relation to frying of the feed. There is thus no indication that reduction in vivo of, for example, the Schiff base from glyceraldehyde, is a pathway for formation of the diHOPrVal. The background level of diHOPrVal in humans Hb is low, and the cancer risk associated with exposure to the specific alkylator-probably glycidol-formed in cooking, is therefore presumably low. The result implies, however, that low-molecular mass mutagenic oxiranes formed during the heating of food should be studied further. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {A device providing frequent, automatic, and non-invasive glucose measurements for persons with diabetes has been developed: the GlucoWatch{\textregistered} biographer. This device extracts glucose through intact skin via reverse iontophoresis where it is detected by an amperometric biosensor. The biographer can provide glucose readings every 20 min for 12 h. The performance of this device was evaluated in two large clinical studies in a controlled clinical environment (n = 231), and the home environment (n = 124). Accuracy of the biographer was evaluated by comparing the automatic biographer readings to serial finger-stick blood glucose (BG) measurements. Biographer performance was comparable in both environments. Mean difference between biographer and finger-stick measurements was -0.01 and 0.26 mmol l-1 for the clinical and home environments, respectively. The mean absolute value of the relative difference was 1.06 and 1.18 mmol l-1 for the same studies. Correlation coefficient (r) between biographer and finger-stick measurements was 0.85 and 0.80 for the two studies. In both studies, over 94{\%} of the biographer readings were in the clinically acceptable A + B region of the Clarke Error Grid. A slight positive bias is observed for the biographer readings at low BG levels. Biographer accuracy is relatively constant over all rates of BG changes, except when BG decreases more than 10 mmol l-1 h-1, which occurred for only 0.2{\%} of points in the home environment study. Biographer precision, as measured by CV{\%}, is approx. 10{\%}. Skin irritation, characterized by erythema and edema, was either non-existent or mild in {\textgreater} 90{\%} of subjects and resolved in virtually all subjects without treatment in several days. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Hemoglobin (Hb) adducts are frequently used to address and/or monitor exposure to reactive chemicals. Glycidol (G), a known animal carcinogen, has been reported to form Hb adducts. Here, we measure G adduct levels in humans who daily ingest DAG oil, an edible oil consisting mainly of diacylglycerol. Since DAG oil contains a small amount of glycidol fatty acid esters (GEs), possible exposure to G released from GEs has been raised as a possible concern. For measurement of Hb adducts, we employed the N-alkyl Edman method reported by Landin et al. (1996) using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with minor modifications to detect G-Hb adducts as N-(2,3-dihydroxy-propyl)valine (diHOPrVal). Blood samples were collected from 7 DAG oil users and 6 non-users, and then G-Hb adduct levels were measured. G-Hb adducts were detected in all samples. The average level of diHOPrVal was 3.5 ± 1.9. pmol/g globin in the DAG oil users and 7.1 ± 3.1. pmol/g globin in the non-users. We conclude that there is no increased exposure to G in individuals who daily ingest DAG oil. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Local variations in the model parameters can play an important explanatory role in the spatial modeling of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. Linear regression models assume parameters to be spatially invariant and are unable to account for the spatially varying relationships in the variables. A recently developed approach, geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK), was used in this study to examine the relationships between environmental variables and SOC stock for the state of Pennsylvania, USA. The specific objectives were to (i) estimate the SOC stock (kgCm-2) to 1.0-m depth, and (ii) compare the GWRK results with those obtained from regression kriging (RK). Data for 878 georeferenced soil profiles, extracted from National Soil Survey Center database, were divided into calibration (n=702) and validation (n=176) datasets. Environmental variables including temperature, precipitation, elevation, slope, geology, land use, and normalized difference vegetation index were explored and included as independent variables to establish the model for estimating the SOC stock. Results using Pennsylvania as a case study conclude that GWRK was the least biased and more accurate compared to RK for estimating the SOC stock based on the lowest root mean square error (2.61 vs. 4.61kgm-2), and high R2(0.36 vs. 0.23) values. Higher stock was consistent with higher precipitation and cooler temperature of the region. Total SOC stock ranged from 1.12 to 1.18Pg for the soils of Pennsylvania. Forests store the highest SOC stock (64{\%} of the total), followed by croplands (22{\%}), wetlands (2.3{\%}), and shrubs (2{\%}). Results show that GWRK enhances the precision for estimating the SOC stock compared to the RK since the former takes into account the spatial non-stationarity coupled with spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The cortical areas that represent affectively positive and negative aspects of touch were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by comparing activations produced by pleasant touch, painful touch produced by a stylus, and neutral touch, to the left hand. It was found that regions of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated more by pleasant touch and by painful stimuli than by neutral touch and that different areas of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated by the pleasant and painful touches. The orbitofrontal cortex activation was related to the affective aspects of the touch, in that the somatosensory cortex (SI) was less activated by the pleasant and painful stimuli than by the neutral stimuli. This dissociation was highly significant for both the pleasant touch (P {\textless} 0.006) and for the painful stimulus (P {\textless} 0.02). Further, it was found that a rostral part of the anterior cingulate cortex was activated by the pleasant stimulus and that a more posterior and dorsal part was activated by the painful stimulus. Regions of the somatosensory cortex, including SI and part of SII in the mid-insula, were activated more by the neutral touch than by the pleasant and painful stimuli. Part of the posterior insula was activated only in the pain condition and different parts of the brainstem, including the central grey, were activated in the pain, pleasant and neutral touch conditions. The results provide evidence that different areas of the human orbitofrontal cortex are involved in representing both pleasant touch and pain, and that dissociable parts of the cingulate cortex are involved in representing pleasant touch and pain.},

Two measurement noise sources were considered: noise in the current drivers and in the voltage detectors. The influence of the acquisition system architecture (serial/semi-parallel) is also discussed. Three variants of backprojection reconstruction are studied: basic (unweighted), weighted and exponential backprojection. The results of error propagation theory have been compared with those obtained from simulated and experimental data. This comparison shows that the approach provides a good estimate of the reconstruction error variance. It is argued that the reconstruction error in EIT images obtained via backprojection can be approximately modeled as a spatially nonstationary Gaussian distribution. This methodology allows us to develop a spatial characterization of the reconstruction error in EIT images.},

Using fMRI, we scanned human subjects who were presented with visual cues that signaled subsequent reinforcement with a pleasant sweet taste (1 M glucose), a moderately unpleasant salt taste (0.2 M saline), or a neutral taste. Expectation of a pleasant taste produced activation in dopaminergic midbrain, posterior dorsal amygdala, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Apart from OFC, these regions were not activated by reward receipt. The findings indicate that when rewards are predictable, brain regions recruited during expectation are, in part, dissociable from areas responding to reward receipt.},

The model partitions the sources of infection into those from within the household and those from the community at large. The parameters reflecting these sources of infection are estimated as functions of the risk factors. This new model is used to overcome problems associated with the lack of independence of observations in infectious disease data and negative confounding due to the association of unmeasured exposures and immunity. An example of how this new statistical model is used to provide a clearer and less confounded description of risk factor effects is presented for data from influenza A(H3N2) epidemic seasons in the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study. The risk factors examined are age and pre-epidemic season antibody level as measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition test, while the outcome is the infection rate. A standard analysis of the data indicates that the efficacy of protective antibodies is 70{\%} in children and only 47{\%} in adults. However, such an efficacy measurement is negatively confounded by past exposure which is age dependent. By means of the model, the true, unconfounded, efficacy of protective antibodies is shown to be 90{\%} in both adults and children.},

abstract = {Importance The increased social and economic burdens for osteoporosis-related fractures worldwide make the prevention of such injuries a major public health goal. Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the association between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and fracture incidence in older adults. Objective To investigate whether calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements are associated with a lower fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults. Data Sources The PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to December 24, 2016, using the keywordscalcium,vitamin D, andfractureto identify systematic reviews or meta-analyses. The primary randomized clinical trials included in systematic reviews or meta-analyses were identified, and an additional search for recently published randomized trials was performed from July 16, 2012, to July 16, 2017. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials comparing calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment for fracture incidence in community-dwelling adults older than 50 years. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction and assessed study quality. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate risk ratios (RRs), absolute risk differences (ARDs), and 95{\%} CIs using random-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures Hip fracture was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, and total fracture. Results A total of 33 randomized trials involving 51 145 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant association of calcium or vitamin D with risk of hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (calcium: RR, 1.53 [95{\%} CI, 0.97 to 2.42]; ARD, 0.01 [95{\%} CI, 0.00 to 0.01]; vitamin D: RR, 1.21 [95{\%} CI, 0.99 to 1.47]; ARD, 0.00 [95{\%} CI, −0.00 to 0.01]. There was no significant association of combined calcium and vitamin D with hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (RR, 1.09 [95{\%} CI, 0.85 to 1.39]; ARD, 0.00 [95{\%} CI, −0.00 to 0.00]). No significant associations were found between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and the incidence of nonvertebral, vertebral, or total fractures. Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally consistent regardless of the calcium or vitamin D dose, sex, fracture history, dietary calcium intake, and baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, the use of supplements that included calcium, vitamin D, or both compared with placebo or no treatment was not associated with a lower risk of fractures among community-dwelling older adults. These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements in community-dwelling older people.},

abstract = {The effects of sleep restriction on energy metabolism and appetite remain controversial. We examined the effects of shortened sleep duration on energy metabolism, core body temperature (CBT), and appetite profiles. Nine healthy men were evaluated in a randomised crossover study under two conditions: a 3.5-h sleep duration and a 7-h sleep duration for three consecutive nights followed by one 7-h recovery sleep night. The subjects' energy expenditure (EE), substrate utilisation, and CBT were continually measured for 48 h using a whole-room calorimeter. The subjects completed an appetite questionnaire every hour while in the calorimeter. Sleep restriction did not affect total EE or substrate utilisation. The 48-h mean CBT decreased significantly during the 3.5-h sleep condition compared with the 7-h sleep condition (7-h sleep, 36.75 ± 0.11 °C; 3.5-h sleep, 36.68 ± 0.14 °C; p = 0.016). After three consecutive nights of sleep restriction, fasting peptide YY levels and fullness were significantly decreased (p = 0.011), whereas hunger and prospective food consumption were significantly increased, compared to those under the 7-h sleep condition. Shortened sleep increased appetite by decreasing gastric hormone levels, but did not affect EE, suggesting that greater caloric intake during a shortened sleep cycle increases the risk of weight gain.},

The neural correlates of contempt have not so far been specifically contrasted with disgust. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural networks involved in the processing of facial contempt and disgust in 24 healthy subjects. Facial recognition of contempt was lower than that of disgust and of neutral faces. The imaging data indicated significant activity in the amygdala and in globus pallidus and putamen during processing of contemptuous faces. Bilateral insula and caudate nuclei and left as well as right inferior frontal gyrus were engaged during processing of disgusted faces. Moreover, direct comparisons of contempt vs. disgust yielded significantly different activations in the amygdala. On the other hand, disgusted faces elicited greater activation than contemptuous faces in the right insula and caudate. Our findings suggest preferential involvement of different neural substrates in the processing of facial emotional expressions of contempt and disgust.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a technique for determining the electrical conductivity and permittivity distribution inside a medium from measurements made on its surface. The impedance distribution reconstruction in EIT is a nonlinear inverse problem that requires the use of a regularization method. The generalized Tikhonov regularization methods are often used in solving inverse problems. However, for EIT image reconstruction, the generalized Tikhonov regularization methods may lose the boundary information due to its smoothing operation. In this paper, we propose an iterative Lavrentiev regularization and L-curve-based algorithm to reconstruct EIT images. The regularization parameter should be carefully chosen, but it is often heuristically selected in the conventional regularization-based reconstruction algorithms. So, an L-curve-based optimization algorithm is used for selecting the Lavrentiev regularization parameter. Numerical analysis and simulation results are performed to illustrate EIT image reconstruction. It is shown that choosing the appropriate regularization parameter plays an important role in reconstructing EIT images.},

Food-related visual stimuli elicited greater responses in the amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus. and anterior fusiform gyrus when participants were in a hungry state relative to a satiated state.

Genome-nutrition divergence describes the misalignment between modern global diets and the genome formed through evolution. A survey of hominin diets over time shows that humans have thrived on a broad range of foods. Earlier diets were highly diverse and nutrient dense, in contrast to modern food systems in which monotonous diets of staple cereals and ultraprocessed foods play a more prominent role. Applying the lens of genome-nutrition divergence to malnutrition reveals shared risk factors for undernutrition and overnutrition at nutrient, food, and environmental levels. Mechanisms for food system shifts, such as crop-neutral agricultural policy, agroecology, and social policy, are explored as a means to realign modern diets with the nutritional patterns to which humans may be better adapted to thrive.},

abstract = {Linear methods of reconstruction play an important role in medical electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and there is a wide variety of algorithms based on several assumptions. With the Graz consensus reconstruction algorithm for EIT (GREIT), a novel linear reconstruction algorithm as well as a standardized framework for evaluating and comparing methods of reconstruction were introduced that found widespread acceptance in the community. In this paper, we propose a two-sided extension of this concept by first introducing a novel method of evaluation. Instead of being based on point-shaped resistivity distributions, we use 2759 pairs of real lung shapes for evaluation that were automatically segmented from human CT data. Necessarily, the figures of merit defined in GREIT were adjusted. Second, a linear method of reconstruction that uses orthonormal eigenimages as training data and a tunable desired point spread function are proposed. Using our novel method of evaluation, this approach is compared to the classical point-shaped approach. Results show that most figures of merit improve with the use of eigenimages as training data. Moreover, the possibility of tuning the reconstruction by modifying the desired point spread function is shown. Finally, the reconstruction of real EIT data shows that higher contrasts and fewer artifacts can be achieved in ventilation- and perfusion-related images.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with asthma who live in the inner city are exposed to multiple indoor allergens and environmental tobacco smoke in their homes. Reductions in these triggers of asthma have been difficult to achieve and have seldom been associated with decreased morbidity from asthma. The objective of this study was to determine whether an environmental intervention tailored to each child's allergic sensitization and environmental risk factors could improve asthma-related outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 937 children with atopic asthma (age, 5 to 11 years) in seven major U.S. cities in a randomized, controlled trial of an environmental intervention that lasted one year (intervention year) and included education and remediation for exposure to both allergens and environmental tobacco smoke. Home environmental exposures were assessed every six months, and asthma-related complications were assessed every two months during the intervention and for one year after the intervention. RESULTS: For every 2-week period, the intervention group had fewer days with symptoms than did the control group both during the intervention year (3.39 vs. 4.20 days, P{\textless}0.001) and the year afterward (2.62 vs. 3.21 days, P{\textless}0.001), as well as greater declines in the levels of allergens at home, such as Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f1) allergen in the bed (P{\textless}0.001) and on the bedroom floor (P=0.004), D. pteronyssinus in the bed (P=0.007), and cockroach allergen on the bedroom floor (P{\textless}0.001). Reductions in the levels of cockroach allergen and dust-mite allergen (Der f1) on the bedroom floor were significantly correlated with reduced complications of asthma (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among inner-city children with atopic asthma, an individualized, home-based, comprehensive environmental intervention decreases exposure to indoor allergens, including cockroach and dust-mite allergens, resulting in reduced asthma-associated morbidity.},

abstract = {Average Customer Rating: 5.0 Rating: 4 Overall good, but could be less technical I was really excited when I ordered this book as it looked like the type of material I had been looking for for ages, but as it turns out I am mildly disappointed in it, primarily because I found the text somewhat hard to grasp and the code not particularly well explained. It is still a very good read though and certainly helped me enhance my knowledge of statistical analyses in R. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to examine spatial data in R, but there is a bit of homework to do to be able to understand how all the pieces fit together. Rating: 5 Just what is needed This book fills a gap in the Spatial Statistics literature. Most of the treatises are heavy on the math, and I find it difficult to bridge the gap between the formulas and applying them. The modules for R take care of this for you and leave you to interpret the result. This book covers most of these modules and demonstrates how to use them. Really worth getting. There is also the ESRI Guide to GIS Analysis Vol 2, but it is more of an introductory text. Rating: 5 Excelent Book! Do you know that felling you may have when you found exactly what you were looking for? Well, that was the felling I had when started to read this book. It brings detailed information about how you can and should use the spatial data analysis resources of R, with interactive examples and enlighten explanations. You will really understand what you are doing and will find ways to represent it the best way you could. Rating: 5 Lots of information, clearly presented. This is not a book for a beginner, but is an excellent book for two groups of readers: those who have some background with R and wish to learn about its capabilities for spatial statistics; and those with some background in spatial statistics who wish to learn how to use R. The authors have been the main developers of the spatial statistics packages on R, and therefore know the packages intimately. But the authors also have a deep knowledge of the spatial statistics literature, and I found myself learning something new about these methods in every chapter. Everyone serious about spatial statistics should see what R has to offer. This book is the easiest way to do that. Rating: 5 The best practial introduction to R spatial The R spatial packages are the leading edge for spatial analysis and spatial statistics. This book, by the primary developers of the R Spatial packages, is the best introduction to the subject that I have seen. Now, if you are comfortable with it, you can dive an and download R and R spatial and go to town. But if you need some help, this is a good place to start. This would also make a good textbook for a class on spatial analysis.},

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a proven method practically used to measure total body fat, and is the most suitable for the measurement of visceral fat accumulation. For the latter purpose, we developed a new simple measurement system using dual current pathways bioelectrical impedance analysis (dual-BIA). This proposed system measures imped ance reflecting the subcutaneous fat volume (SFV) and the fat free volume (FFV) in the abdomen by passing current via respective pathways. Regarding to measure these two imped ance values we adopted the four electrodes method. The VFA was calculated by using these two impedance values and abdominal body shape data to minimize the influence of FFV and SFV. We compared the VFA measured by dual-BIA system with that measured by X-ray CT in 98 subjects, and found a high correlation coefficient (r=0.888, p{\textless}0.001). Our proposed system is suggested to be useful for a simple visceral fat accumulation measurement.},

We recorded trial characteristics and planned recruitment from included protocols. Last follow-up of RCTs was April 27, 2013.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Completion status, reported reasons for discontinuation, and publication status of RCTs as determined by correspondence with the research ethics committees, literature searches, and investigator surveys.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.6 years (range, 8.8-12.6 years), 253 of 1017 included RCTs were discontinued (24.9{\%} [95{\%} CI, 22.3{\%}-27.6{\%}]). Only 96 of 253 discontinuations (37.9{\%} [95{\%} CI, 32.0{\%}-44.3{\%}]) were reported to ethics committees. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was poor recruitment (101/1017; 9.9{\%} [95{\%} CI, 8.2{\%}-12.0{\%}]). In multivariable analysis, industry sponsorship vs investigator sponsorship (8.4{\%} vs 26.5{\%}; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95{\%} CI, 0.15-0.43]; P {\textless} .001) and a larger planned sample size in increments of 100 (-0.7{\%}; OR, 0.96 [95{\%} CI, 0.92-1.00]; P = .04) were associated with lower rates of discontinuation due to poor recruitment.

abstract = {This study investigated the period of time that blood pressure (BP) should be measured at home in older patients in order to obtain steady BP values. Thirty-six men and 38 women ({\textgreater} or =60 years) were recruited at one family practice. At one office visit the family physician measured supine, sitting and standing BPs three times consecutively in each position. During 10 consecutive days, BP was measured at home five times daily. The supine and standing BPs were measured once in the morning and in the evening and the sitting BP once at noon. These home BP values were averaged over the first day (1-day), over the first 3 days (3-day) and all 10 days (10-day) of measurements. In both the supine (-5.1 mm Hg) and sitting (-3.8 mm Hg) positions the 10-day average systolic home BP was significantly lower than the corresponding office BP. The opposite was observed for the 10-day average standing home BP values (+7.3/+3.4 mm Hg). Comparison of the 3-day and 10-day average home BP values showed only a significantly lower 10-day than 3-day systolic BP level in the supine position (-1.1 mm Hg, 95{\%} CI -1.9 to -0.2 mm Hg). Repeated measures ANOVA, showed a small but significant decrease over time only for the supine systolic home BP (-0.29 mm Hg per day, 95{\%} CI -0.49 to -0.08 mm Hg per day). We conclude that in older subjects, 3 days of home measurements may suffice to obtain steady values for the sitting and standing BPs. A longer interval might be required for the supine BP.},

DESIGN A prospective study conducted for 3 months from January to March 2005. SETTINGS/LOCATION A nursing home in Japan. SUBJECTS A total of 124 elderly residents of at least 65 years of age were enrolled in the study. Seventy-six residents (83 +/-8.2 years, mean +/-standard deviation; 24 men, 52 women) gargled with tea catechin extract (catechin group) and were compared with 48 age- and sex-matched residents who gargled without tea catechin extracts (control group). All the residents were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine until early December 2004. INTERVENTIONS catechin group: gargling with the tea catechin extract solution (200 microg/mL catechins, 60{\%} of catechins comprise epigallocatechin gallate); control group: gargling without the catechin extract solution. In both groups, gargling was performed three times daily for 3 months. OUTCOME MEASURES The incidence of influenza infection during the study was compared between the two groups. A safety evaluation was conducted to observe adverse events during the study. RESULTS The incidence of influenza infection was significantly lower in the catechin group (1.3{\%}, one resident) than in the control group (10{\%}, five residents) calculated by multivariate logistic regression analysis (p = 0.028; odds ratio, 15.711; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.883-399.658). No adverse events, such as respiratory tract irritation, an obstruction, or allergic bronchial spasm, were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS This prospective study demonstrating the effect of catechin gargling on the prevention of influenza infection in the elderly is the first to be reported in the literature. Further randomized, controlled studies are needed to confirm the effects of catechin gargling on the prevention of influenza infection.},

We propose a time-varying parametric projection filter (tPPF) for the spatio-temporal EEG analysis. The performance of this tPPF algorithm was evaluated by computer simulation studies. An inhomogeneous three-concentric-spheres model was used in the present simulation study to represent the head volume conductor. An equivalent dipole layer was used to represent equivalently brain electric sources and estimated from the scalp potentials. The tPPF filter was tested to remove time-varying noise such as instantaneous artifacts caused by eyes-blink.

abstract = {BACKGROUND To examine an association between self-reported sleep quality determined by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and metabolic syndrome. METHODS This study was designed as cross-sectional study. Participants were 1481 adults aged 20 years and above from general population (549 males and 932 females). We assessed the global sleep quality by PSQI. PSQI consists of 7 elements, i.e. subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (prolonged sleep onset time), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency (proportion of hours slept to hours spent in bed), sleep disturbance (interruption of sleep), use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction (trouble staying awake while engaging in social activity). Any participants with score of 6 or more are diagnosed to have sleep disorder. We also assessed the above 7 elements, which consisted of a four-grade system (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3). Metabolic syndrome consisted of abdominal obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was done when the participants have abdominal obesity and meet two or more other components. All analyses were adjusted by age, drinking habit, smoking habit, working hours, exercise habit and depression. RESULTS Fifty-two male participants (9.5{\%}) and 133 female (14.3{\%}) scored 6 or more points in global PSQI score. The global PSQI score, sleep latency score and sleep disturbance score of participants with metabolic syndrome were higher level than those without the condition (p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.009, p = 0.025 for male and p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.002 for females, respectively). The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome among participants with PSQI score of 6 or more points were 2.37 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.23-4.58) for males and 2.71 (1.45-5.07) for females in contrast to those with 5 or less points. The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome with sleep latency score of 2 was 2.65 (1.14-6.15) for male and 3.82 (1.81-8.09) for females in contrast with those of 0. The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome with sleep disturbance score of 1 was 1.76 (1.09-2.86) for males and 2.43 (1.26-4.69) for females in contrast with those of 0. CONCLUSIONS Global PSQI score and its components (especially, sleep latency and sleep disturbance) were associated with metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between nutrient intake, partitioning of food intake, parents' overweight and adiposity in a group of children. SUBJECTS: 530 7-11-year-old children: 278 males, 252 females. METHODS: Energy intake, nutrient intake and percentage distribution of the intake of energy among the different meals were assessed by means of diet history. Body composition was obtained by measuring skinfold thickness. RESULTS: We identified the relationship between the children's adiposity and their parents' body mass index (BMI) mother: r=0.12, P{\textless}0.01; father: r=0.13; P{\textless}0.01), carbohydrate (r=-0. 15, P{\textless}0.001) and fat intake (r=0.14, P{\textless}0.002), and the proportion of energy taken at dinner (r=0.1, P{\textless}0.05). A multiple regression analysis was run with a stepwise procedure using relative adiposity as the dependent variable and parents' BMI, dinner intake (percentage of energy intake), EI/BMR ratio (an index of energy intake validity), and sex (dummy variable) as independent variables. All the independent variables, except percentage of fat intake, were included in the final model. The equation was able to explain approximately 19{\%} (R=0.44, P{\textless}0.001) of inter-individual fat mass percentage variability. CONCLUSIONS: Diet composition did not contribute to explain the children's adiposity when the parents' overweight (BMI) was taken into account. However, the percentage distribution of the intake of energy among the different meals, particularly at dinner, contributed to explain inter-individual variance of fatness in children of both sexes.

abstract = {In order to understand the high efficacy of camptothecin derivatives against human colon tumor xenografts in nude mice, we have studied the transport properties of camptothecin derivatives across cellular membranes of MDR1-overexpressing cells. MDR1 overexpression was shown to have little effect on camptothecin cytotoxicity; camptothecin was equally cytotoxic to both the drug-sensitive parental cell line, KB 3-1, and its multidrug-resistant derivative, KB V1. The ability of camptothecin to overcome MDR1-mediated resistance is most likely due to unimpaired accumulation of camptothecin in MDR1 cells as suggested from the following experiments: (a) cytotoxicity of camptothecin against KB V1 cells was not altered by the known MDR1-reversing agent, verapamil; (b) camptothecin was ineffective as compared with vinblastine in competing with [3H]azidopine for photoaffinity labeling of MDR1; (c) camptothecin was equally efficient in trapping cellular topoisomerase I molecules on chromosomal DNA in the form of cleavable complexes in both KB 3-1 and KB V1 cells. The mechanism by which camptothecin overcomes MDR1-mediated resistance has been further studied using a number of uncharged and charged camptothecin derivatives. In contrast to the uncharged camptothecin derivatives, such as 9-amino-camptothecin and 10,11-methylenedioxy-camptothecin, the charged camptothecin derivative, topotecan, showed reduced cytotoxicity against MDR1-overexpressing KB V1 cells. The reduced cytotoxicity of topotecan in KB V1 cells was due to the overexpression of MDR1 in KB V1 cells since verapamil restored both topotecan accumulation and cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the charge on camptothecin can affect the drug's sensitivity to MDR1. The possible effect of membrane permeability in determining drug selectivity of MDR1 is discussed.},

We performed an fMRI study in which participants inhaled odorants producing a strong feeling of disgust. The same participants observed video clips showing the emotional facial expression of disgust. Observing such faces and feeling disgust activated the same sites in the anterior insula and to a lesser extent in the anterior cingulate cortex. Thus, as observing hand actions activates the observer's motor representation of that action, observing an emotion activates the neural representation of that emotion. This finding provides a unifying mechanism for understanding the behaviors of others.},

abstract = {SUMMARY OBJECTIVE In addition to the waist circumference (WC) measurement, an accurate measurement of visceral fat is very important in terms of the pathology associated with the metabolic syndrome. The only method available for an accurate measurement of a visceral fat area (VFA) is abdominal computed tomography (CT). To overcome this limitation, we estimated VFA using abdominal bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with accuracy comparable to that of abdominal CT, and investigated the relationship between VFA and risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. Because abdominal BIA detects excess visceral fat accumulation that cannot be detected by a measurement of WC, the characteristics of the subjects who were identified as having excessive visceral fat using BIA, but not WC, were examined. METHODS Abdominal BIA was used to estimate VFA in male subjects (n = 1803) (age: 48 ± 10 years, body mass index: 23.9 ± 3.0 kg/m(2)) who provided informed consent. RESULTS The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome diagnosed based on the diagnostic criteria established by the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine was 18{\%}. Among the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, WC was significantly correlated with triglycerides (TG), but estimated VFA was correlated with blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), in addition to TG. Abdominal BIA detected excess visceral fat accumulation in 3{\%} of subjects for whom WC had detected none. Elevated blood pressure, TG, and fasting plasma glucose and decreased HDL-C were also noted in these subjects, and the values of these risk factors were comparable to those of subjects in whom visceral fat accumulation was detected using WC. CONCLUSION Abdominal BIA is a simple and safe method that is superior to WC for the detection of excessive visceral fat accumulation. Therefore, abdominal BIA will likely be used clinically to detect excessive accumulation of visceral fat, which is an important predictor of the metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore neuroanatomical sites of eating behavior, we have developed a simple functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to image hunger vs. satiety using visual stimulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND PROCEDURES: Twelve healthy, lean, nonsmoking male subjects participated in this study. Pairs of food-neutral and food-related pictures were presented in a block design, after a 14-h fast and 1 h after ad libitum ingestion of a mixed meal. Statistically, a general linear model for serially autocorrelated observations with a P level{\textless}0.001 was used.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the hunger condition, significantly enhanced brain activity was found in the left striate and extrastriate cortex, the inferior parietal lobe, and the orbitofrontal cortices. Stimulation with food images was associated with increased activity in both insulae, the left striate and extrastriate cortex, and the anterior midprefrontal cortex. Nonfood images were associated with enhanced activity in the right parietal lobe and the left and right middle temporal gyrus. A significant interaction in activation pattern between the states of hunger and satiety and stimulation with food and nonfood images was found for the left anterior cingulate cortex, the superior occipital sulcus, and in the vicinity of the right amygdala.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: These preliminary data from a homogenous healthy male cohort suggest that central nervous system (CNS) activation is not only altered with hunger and satiety but that food and nonfood images have also specific effects on regional brain activity if exposure takes place in different states of satiety. Wider use of our or a similar approach would help to establish a uniform paradigm to map hunger and satiety to be used for further experiments.},

abstract = {A good understanding and characterization of the dose response relationship of any new compound is an important and ubiquitous problem in many areas of scientific investigation. This is especially true in the context of pharmaceutical drug development, where it is mandatory to launch safe drugs which demonstrate a clinically relevant effect. Selecting a dose too high may result in unacceptable safety problems, while selecting a dose too low may lead to ineffective drugs. Dose finding studies thus play a key role in any drug development program and are often the gate-keeper for large confirmatory studies. In this overview paper we focus on definitive and confirmatory dose finding studies in Phase II or III, reviewing relevant statistical design and analysis methods. In particular, we describe multiple comparison procedures, modeling approaches, and hybrid methods combining the advantages of both. An outlook to adaptive dose finding methods is also given. We use a real data example to illustrate the methods, together with a brief overview of relevant software.},

abstract = {Despite being a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, obesity has been thought to protect against osteoporosis. However, recent studies have demonstrated a differential impact of specific fat compartments on bone mineral density (BMD) with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) having potential detrimental effects on BMD. Visceral obesity is also associated with dysregulation of the GH/IGF-1 axis, an important regulator of bone homeostasis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the differential effects of abdominal fat depots and muscle, vitamin D, and hormonal determinants, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), testosterone, and estradiol, on trabecular BMD of the lumbar spine. We studied 68 healthy obese premenopausal women (mean BMI, 36.7??4.2kg/m2). Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) was used to assess body composition and lumbar trabecular BMD. There was an inverse association between BMD and VAT, independent of age and BMI (p=0.003). IGF-1 correlated positively with BMD and negatively with VAT and, in stepwise multivariate regression modeling, was the strongest predictor of BMD and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP). Thigh muscle cross sectional area (CSA) and thigh muscle density were also associated with BMD (p{\textless}0.05), but 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], testosterone, free testosterone, and estradiol levels were not. 25(OH)D was associated inversely with BMI, total, and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (p{\textless}0.05). These findings support the hypothesis that VAT exerts detrimental effects, whereas muscle mass exerts positive effects on BMD in premenopausal obese women. Moreover, our findings suggest that IGF-1 may be a mediator of the deleterious effects of VAT on bone health through effects on bone formation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the pattern of the metabolic syndrome in Chinese and the causal relationships among its components, including aging, obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia in these subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, the World Health Organization criteria were used for the diagnosis of glucose intolerance in a population-based study involving 1.513 Chinese subjects in two work sites. Demographic data including age, family history of diabetes, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and sitting blood pressure (BP) were documented. Fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride (TG) and insulin concentrations, and spot urinary albumin concentration (Ualb) were also measured. Structural equation modeling incorporating factor analysis and path analysis was performed to examine the causal relationships among these variables and their interactions. RESULTS Subjects who were treated with antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive drugs or who had a plasma creatinine level {\textgreater} or = 150 mumol/l were excluded (n = 52). The prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were 3.9{\%} (n = 34) and 7.2{\%} (n = 63) in men (n = 881) and 3.1{\%} (n = 18) and 6.7{\%} (n = 39) in women (n = 580), respectively. In both groups, glucose intolerance was associated with increasing age, higher BMI, WHR, BP, Ualb, serum TG, and insulin levels as well as higher prevalence rates of positive family history of diabetes. Structural equation modeling showed that age was a significant determinant for both BMI and WHR. Age and obesity accounted for most of the variance of BP, Ualb, plasma glucose, insulin and TG levels either directly or indirectly. Plasma glucose was determined by a positive family history of diabetes, age, and BMI while TG was dependent on BMI and WHR. Serum insulin was mainly determined by a positive family history of diabetes, obesity, plasma glucose, and TG levels. Apart from age and obesity, BP was also determined by serum insulin, both of which had causal effects on Ualb. CONCLUSIONS This model emphasizes the centrality of aging and obesity as well as a positive family history of diabetes as major determinants of the components of the metabolic syndrome. These components in turn had causal effects upon one another. Apart from a familial tendency, a central neurohormonal mechanism may account for these abnormalities mediated primarily through obesity and in close association with aging.},

Psychophysical ratings of pleasantness or intensity were collected after each presentation of a taste stimulus and water, with the general labeled magnitude scale, using a joystick that controlled the movement of an arrow on the visual display. Performing these cognitive tasks required that the participant remained focused, and aided in the interpretation of the data collected. The perceived pleasantness differed across stimuli for all conditions; however, pleasantness ratings for the same stimulus displayed consistency, over the duration of the run and before each scan on separate days. Activation in response to sucrose and caffeine while the participant rated pleasantness was found in the insula, frontal operculum, rolandic operculum and orbitofrontal cortex which is consistent with previous taste fMRI studies. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

From a dataset of 419 cases, including 92 malignancies, 13 features relating to mammographic findings, physical examinations and patients' clinical histories, were extracted to build three Bayesian belief networks. The scenarios tested included a network incorporating all features and two hybrids which combined the outputs of sub-networks corresponding to the image or non-image features. Average areas (Az) under the corresponding ROC curves were used as measures of performance. The network incorporating only image based features performed better (Az =0.81) than that using nonimage features (Az = 0.71). Both hybrid classifiers yielded better performance (Az =0.85 for averaging and Az = 0.87 for logistic regression), but neither hybrid was as accurate as the network incorporating all features (Az = 0.89). This preliminary study suggests that, like human observers who concurrently consider different types of information, a single classifier that simultaneously evaluates both image and non-image information can achieve better diagnostic performance than the hybrid combinations considered here.},

In six healthy male volunteers, Oligonol?? significantly decreased 1-h uric acid excretion and fractional uric acid clearance, which was accompanied by a decreased serum concentration of uric acid. In addition, an in vitro experiment showed that Oligonol?? inhibited buttermilk xanthine oxidase activity in a dose-dependent manner.

Furthermore, the study did not test the use of WC alone as an indicator of VFA even though others had previously reported a strong correlation. We sought to determine the optimal measurement technique and analysis for measuring VFA by abdominal BIA and WC. 18 volunteers (age 23-64 years) underwent measurement of WC, abdominal impedance (Bodystat 500 four-electrode system) and a single cross-sectional CT scan at the umbilicus. VFA derived using WC(3) and measurements of abdominal impedance from electrode pairs sited at the flank predicted the value of VFA measured by CT with correlation r = 0.904 (p {\textless} 0.0001); the optimizing power of WC was 3.3 (r = 0.905). However, the use of WC(1.9) alone, without involving BIA at all, provided a similar correlation (r = 0.923). Our small preliminary study shows that abdominal BIA is potentially a practicable non-invasive technique for measurement of VFA but casts doubt on whether it adds any value to the use of WC alone. Larger studies are now required to test this finding.},

abstract = {Abdominal fat accumulation is considered an essential indicator of human health. Electrical impedance tomography has considerable potential for abdominal fat imaging because of the low specific conductivity of human body fat. In this paper, we propose a robust reconstruction method for high-fidelity conductivity imaging by abstraction of the abdominal cross section using a relatively small number of parameters. Toward this end, we assume homogeneous conductivity in the abdominal subcutaneous fat area and characterize its geometrical shape by parameters defined as the ratio of the distance from the center to boundary of subcutaneous fat to the distance from the center to outer boundary in 64 equiangular directions. To estimate the shape parameters, the sensitivity of the noninvasively measured voltages with respect to the shape parameters is formulated for numerical optimization. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. A 3-dimensional finite element method is used to construct a computer model of the human abdomen. The inverse problems of shape parameters and conductivities are solved concurrently by iterative forward and inverse calculations. As a result, conductivity images are reconstructed with a small systemic error of less than 1{\%} for the estimation of the subcutaneous fat area. A novel method is devised for estimating the boundary of the abdominal subcutaneous fat. The fidelity of the overall reconstructed image to the reference image is significantly improved. The results demonstrate the possibility of realization of an abdominal fat scanner as a low-cost, radiation-free medical device.},

However, the subcutaneous fat area showed no statistically significant relationship with BMD at most sites. Among the metabolic parameters, HDL cholesterol was positively associated with BMD, while LDL cholesterol was negatively associated with BMD in men. In women, total and LDL cholesterol were negatively associated with BMD at the lumbar spine. We conclude that visceral adiposity is inversely associated with BMD after adjusting for confounders and that metabolic factors may partly contribute to this inverse relation.},

abstract = {Eating is not only triggered by hunger but also by the sight of foods. Viewing appetizing foods alone can induce food craving and eating, although there is considerable variation in this "external food sensitivity" (EFS). Because increased EFS is associated with overeating, identifying its neural correlates is important for understanding the current epidemic of obesity. Animal research has identified the ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, medial prefrontal and premotor cortices as key interacting structures for feeding. However, it is unclear whether a similar network exists in humans and how it is affected by EFS. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that viewing appetizing compared with bland foods produced changes in connectivity among the human ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate and premotor cortex that were strongly correlated with EFS. Differences in the dynamic interactions within the human appetitive network in response to pictures of appetizing foods may determine an individual's risk of obesity.},

However, there has been no study on this. We studied this relationship using virtual routes that were projected in CAVE with five screens in stereo-vision. We arranged objects around the virtual route and prepared two sets of conditions. One was low density, which means the virtual routes were surrounded with not many objects. The other was high density, which means there were many objects. The results of our experiment show that the number of objects (the density of arranged objects around the virtual route) affected the user's perception of distance, speed, and time. The influence on the perception of time was smaller than that on distance and speed. Under the high density condition, the users felt that the distance and time was longer and the speed faster.},

The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to evaluate relationships between anthropometric parameters of general obesity (body mass index, BMI) and fat distribution (waist/hip ratio, WHR) and bone mineral content (BMC), and (2) to compare BMC (a) between obese men (BMI {\textgreater}or= 27) and nonobese men and (b) between abdominally obese men (WHR {\textgreater}or= 0.95) and men without visceral adiposity, in a population-based sample of Polish men. The sample comprised a group of 272 men, aged 20-60, randomly selected from healthy and occupationally active inhabitants of Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland. Trabecular, cortical and total BMC at the ultra-distal radius of the nondominant hand were assessed by pQCT using the Stratec 960 apparatus. BMI and WHR were used as parameters of general obesity and fat distribution, respectively. The relationships among the analysed variables were established using a multiple linear regression. The differences in BMC depending on BMI and WHR values were tested using an analysis of covariance (ancova). BMI was positively related only to trabecular BMC (r = 0.17; P = 0.03). Only trabecular BMC was higher in men with BMI {\textgreater}or= 27 compared to nonoverweight subjects (F = 5.38; P = 0.02). WHR was inversely related to trabecular (r = - 0.30; P {\textless} 0.001), cortical (r = - 0.30; P {\textless} 0.001) and total BMC (r = - 0.34; P {\textless} 0.001). All densitometric parameters were lower in males with WHR {\textgreater}or= 0.95 than in normal men (results of ancova: for trabecular BMC, F = 6.33, P = 0.01; for cortical BMC, F = 5.52, P = 0.02, and for total BMC, F = 7.73, P = 0.006). In the healthy Polish male population, BMI was of minor significance as a predictor of BMC at the ultra-distal radius, whereas visceral adiposity (assessed by WHR) was significantly linked to reduced bone mass in men.},

Dietary intake was assessed by using a validated 147-item food-frequency questionnaire. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) scores were derived from the nutrient intake. A multilevel logistic regression model was used to estimate ORs and 95{\%} CIs of self-reported, physician-diagnosed T2D over 5 y, with adjustment for potential confounding variables.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 1191 cases of newly diagnosed T2D were reported. PRAL score was positively associated with T2D in men; the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95{\%} CIs) for the lowest through the highest quartiles of PRAL were 1.00, 1.09 (0.87, 1.36), 1.10 (0.88, 1.37), and 1.25 (1.01, 1.55) (P-trend = 0.047). Further adjustment for dietary intake strengthened the association. NEAP score was not associated with the risk of T2D (P-trend = 0.20). In stratified analyses, the positive association between PRAL and T2D was confined to younger men (age {\textless}50 y; P-trend = 0.046). There was no association between dietary acid load score and T2D in women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A high dietary acid load score is associated with an increased risk of T2D in Japanese men.},

abstract = {Background {\&} aims: Diacylglycerol oil has been shown to lower postprandial and fasting serum triacylglycerol levels and reduce body fat. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diacylglycerol oil on risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease in type 2 DM patients. Methods: This was a double-blind controlled parallel study with 127 type 2 DM patients (aged 40-65) recruited in Hangzhou, China. All subjects consumed triacylglycerol oil in the lead-in period (14 days), then they were randomly divided into two groups and consumed diacylglycerol or triacylglycerol oil with a similar fatty acid composition (25 g/day) for 120 days. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 60 and 120 and risk factors of type 2 DM and cardiovascular disease and biochemical parameters were measured by standard methods. Results: There were a total of 112 subjects who completed the study. Diet intake did not differ significantly between groups. Body weight, BMI, waist circumference, HOMA-IR, serum insulin and leptin levels were significantly reduced from baseline in the diacylglycerol oil group but not in the triacylglycerol oil group. Serum glucose was also significantly improved in patients with higher glucose levels at baseline ({\textgreater}7.00 mmol/L) in the diacylglycerol oil group. Parameters of liver and kidney functions and essential fatty acids in serum phospholipids did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Diacylglycerol oil consumption improved biomarkers and anthropometric parameters of type 2 DM compared with triacylglycerol oil. No adverse reactions were observed with diacylglycerol oil consumption for type 2 DM patients. Diacylglycerol oil has an equivalent bioavailability as triacylglycerol oil in relation to providing essential fatty acids. ? 2008 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

abstract = {In bone marrow, osteoblasts and adipocytes are differentiated from mesenchymal progenitor cells and their differentiation is reciprocally regulated by largely unknown mechanisms. In this study, we investigated downstream signaling cascades of adiponectin, a member of the adipocytokine family, in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Adiponectin augmented expression of several osteogenic marker genes and increased osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal progenitor cells. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) was potently increased by adiponectin, whereas inhibition of COX2 activity abolished the effect of adiponectin on osteogenesis. In addition, adiponectin rapidly stimulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase via the adiponectin receptor, AdipoR1, which resulted in c-Jun activation for COX2 expression. Adiponectin also stimulated BMP2 expression in a COX2-dependent manner. Moreover, Runx2, a key osteogenic transcription factor, contributed to the acceleration of osteogenesis in the presence of adiponectin. Collectively, the finding that adiponectin could promote osteogenesis through an intracellular signaling cascade in mesenchymal progenitor cells suggests that adiponectin would be a potential therapeutic target for bone-related diseases.},

Regarding variability in systolic blood pressure response to change in sodium intake, with higher versus lower sodium levels (78-mmol sodium difference), the range of systolic blood pressure change was -32 to +17 mm Hg; 33.5{\%} decreased {\textgreater} or =10 mm Hg. Regarding consistency of response, systolic blood pressure change with run-in versus lower sodium was modestly correlated with systolic blood pressure change with higher versus medium sodium; systolic blood pressure change with higher versus lower sodium was similarly correlated with run-in versus medium sodium (combined Spearman r=0.27, P=0.002). These results show low-order consistency of response and confirm that identifying individuals as sodium responders is difficult. They support current recommendations for lower salt intake directed at the general public rather than "susceptible" individuals as one of several strategies to prevent and control adverse blood pressures widely prevalent in the adult population.},

abstract = {Global pressure-volume (PV) curves are an adjunct measure to describe lung characteristics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is convincing evidence that high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) cause barotrauma, while optimized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) helps avoid mechanical injury to the lungs by preventing repeated alveolar opening and closing. The optimal values of PIP and PEEP are deduced from the shape of the PV curve by the identification of so-called lower and upper inflection points. However, it has been demonstrated using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) that the inflection points vary across the lung. This study employs a simple curve-fitting technique to automatically define inflection points on both pressure-volume (PV) and pressure-impedance (PI) curves to asses the differences between global PV and regional PI estimates in animals before and after induced lung injury. The results demonstrate a clear increase in lower inflection point (LIP) along the gravitational axis both before and after lung injury. Moreover, it is clear from comparison of the local EIT-derived LIPs with those derived from global PV curves that a ventilation strategy based on the PV curve alone may leave dependent areas of the lung collapsed. EIT-based PI curve analysis may help choosing an optimal ventilation strategy.},

abstract = {Obesity has been associated with a higher risk for impaired cognitive function, which most likely reflects associated medical complications (i.e., cerebrovascular pathology). However, there is also evidence that in healthy individuals excess weight may adversely affect cognition (executive function, attention, and memory). Here, we measured regional brain glucose metabolism (using positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)) to assess the relationship between BMI and brain metabolism (marker of brain function) in 21 healthy controls (BMI range 19-37 kg/m(2)) studied during baseline (no stimulation) and during cognitive stimulation (numerical calculations). Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) revealed a significant negative correlation between BMI and metabolic activity in prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 44) and cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 32) but not in other regions. Moreover, baseline metabolism in these prefrontal regions was positively associated with performance on tests of memory (California Verbal Learning Test) and executive function (Stroop Interference and Symbol Digit Modality tests). In contrast, the regional brain changes during cognitive stimulation were not associated with BMI nor with neuropsychological performance. The observed association between higher BMI and lower baseline prefrontal metabolism may underlie the impaired performance reported in healthy obese individuals on some cognitive tests of executive function. On the other hand, the lack of an association between BMI and brain metabolic activation during cognitive stimulation indicates that BMI does not influence brain glucose utilization during cognitive performance. These results further highlight the urgency to institute public health interventions to prevent obesity.},

abstract = {Background: The thermogenic effects of green tea catechin have been repeatedly reported, but their mechanisms are poorly understood.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effects of catechin on brown adipose tissue (BAT), a site specialized for nonshivering thermogenesis, in humans.Design: Fifteen healthy male volunteers underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography to assess BAT activity. To examine the acute catechin effect, whole-body energy expenditure (EE) after a single oral ingestion of a beverage containing 615 mg catechin and 77 mg caffeine (catechin beverage) was measured. Next, to investigate the chronic catechin effects, 10 men with low BAT activity were enrolled. Before and after ingestion of the catechin beverage 2 times/d for 5 wk, cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) after 2 h of cold exposure at 19°C, which is proportional to BAT activity, was examined. Both the acute and chronic trials were single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, season-matched crossover studies.Results: A single ingestion of the catechin beverage increased EE in 9 subjects who had metabolically active BAT (mean ± SEM: +15.24 ± 1.48 kcal, P {\textless} 0.01) but not in 6 subjects who had negligible activities (mean ± SEM: +3.42 ± 2.68 kcal). The ingestion of a placebo beverage containing 82 mg caffeine produced a smaller and comparative EE response in the 2 subject groups. Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between BAT and catechin on EE ($\beta$ = 0.496, P = 0.003). Daily ingestion of the catechin beverage elevated mean ± SEM CIT (from 92.0 ± 26.5 to 197.9 ± 27.7 kcal/d; P = 0.009), whereas the placebo beverage did not change it.Conclusion: Orally ingested tea catechin with caffeine acutely increases EE associated with increased BAT activity and chronically elevates nonshivering CIT, probably because of the recruitment of BAT, in humans. These trials were registered at www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as UMIN000016361.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between total plasma homocysteine concentration, C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in MTHFR gene and Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. METHOD: Forty-three patients with probable (63{\%}) and possible (37{\%}) AD and 50 non-demented controls were evaluated. Groups did not differ as to gender, age, scholar years, diabetes, alcohol and coffee intake and physical activity. Total plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels were determined by HPLC and genotyping for MTHFR by PCR/RFLP. Mann-Whitney "U" test was used to compare quantitative variable, Fisher-Freeman-Halton test to compare genotypes and allele proportions and Chi-square test to other qualitative variables. RESULTS: AD patients presented higher total plasma Hcy levels than controls and the difference was statistically significant. No differences in the C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms distributions were found between patients and controls. Plasma homocysteine concentration did not change with MTHFR genotypes. CONCLUSION: Our data confirms the association between increased plasma Hcy concentration and AD and suggests that neither C677T nor A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms contributed to genetic susceptibility for AD in elderly individuals in the Northeast of Brazil.},

METHODS AND SUBJECTS Based on the Japanese definition of metabolic syndrome, in the annual health checkup for general subjects, the measurement of waist circumference and use of "Where am I?" chart on the way to develop atherosclerosis were introduced. The study group comprised 3,174 Japanese employees [2,440 males (46±11 years, mean ± SD), 734 females (43±10 years)], who underwent annual health checkup in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The medical staff provided "Hokenshido" for subjects assessed as having MetS and/or at high risk for CVD. RESULTS The prevalence of the MetS in 2003, 2004 and 2005 decreased in males (20.8{\%}, 17.2{\%}, 14.4{\%}, p{\textless}0.001) and females (3.0{\%}, 2.2{\%}, 1.9{\%}, p=0.359), respectively. Among subjects with MetS at baseline, the number of subjects with MetS significantly decreased in males (508, 287, 247, p{\textless}0.0001) and females (22, 8, 6, p{\textless}0.0001), respectively. Mean waist loss was 1.6 cm in males ({\textless}0.0001) and 1.5 cm in females ({\textless}0.001). Among subjects with metabolic syndrome at baseline, the mean waist loss was 2.5 cm in males ({\textless}0.0001) and 3.9 cm in females ({\textless}0.05). Fatal atherosclerotic vascular events were not recorded in this study period. CONCLUSION Health check-up and the "Hokenshido" program reduced the prevalence of the MetS, which might lead to prevention of CVD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In laboratory animals, the consumption of soy protein, rather than animal protein, decreases serum cholesterol concentrations, but studies in humans have been inconclusive. In this meta-analysis of 38 controlled clinical trials, we examined the relation between soy protein consumption and serum lipid concentrations in humans. METHODS: We used a random-effects model to quantify the average effects of soy protein intake on serum lipids in the studies we examined and used hierarchical mixed-effects regression models to predict variation as a function of the characteristics of the studies. RESULTS: In most of the studies, the intake of energy, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol was similar when the subjects ingested control and soy-containing diets; soy protein intake averaged 47 g per day. Ingestion of soy protein was associated with the following net changes in serum lipid concentrations from the concentrations reached with the control diet: total cholesterol, a decrease of 23.2 mg per deciliter (0.60 mmol per liter); 95 percent confidence interval, 13.5 to 32.9 mg per deciliter [0.35 to 0.85 mmol per liter]), or 9.3 percent; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a decrease of 21.7 mg per deciliter (0.56 mmol per liter); 95 percent confidence interval, 11.2 to 31.7 mg per deciliter [0.30 to 0.82 mmol per liter]), or 12.9 percent; and triglycerides, a decrease of 13.3 mg per deciliter (0.15 mmol per liter; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 25.7 mg per deciliter [0.003 to 0.29 mmol per liter]), or 10.5 percent. The changes in serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations were directly related to the initial serum cholesterol concentration (P {\textless} 0.001). The ingestion of soy protein was associated with a nonsignificant 2.4 percent increase in serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis we found that the consumption of soy protein rather than animal protein significantly decreased serum concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides without significantly affecting serum HDL cholesterol concentrations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The relationship between central obesity and survival in community-dwelling adults with normal body mass index (BMI) is not well-known. OBJECTIVE To examine total and cardiovascular mortality risks associated with central obesity and normal BMI. DESIGN Stratified multistage probability design. SETTING NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). PARTICIPANTS 15,184 adults (52.3{\%} women) aged 18 to 90 years. MEASUREMENTS Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship of obesity patterns defined by BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and total and cardiovascular mortality risk after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS Persons with normal-weight central obesity had the worst long-term survival. For example, a man with a normal BMI (22 kg/m2) and central obesity had greater total mortality risk than one with similar BMI but no central obesity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87 [95{\%} CI, 1.53 to 2.29]), and this man had twice the mortality risk of participants who were overweight or obese according to BMI only (HR, 2.24 [CI, 1.52 to 3.32] and 2.42 [CI, 1.30 to 4.53], respectively). Women with normal-weight central obesity also had a higher mortality risk than those with similar BMI but no central obesity (HR, 1.48 [CI, 1.35 to 1.62]) and those who were obese according to BMI only (HR, 1.32 [CI, 1.15 to 1.51]). Expected survival estimates were consistently lower for those with central obesity when age and BMI were controlled for. LIMITATIONS Body fat distribution was assessed based on anthropometric indicators alone. Information on comorbidities was collected by self-report. CONCLUSION Normal-weight central obesity defined by WHR is associated with higher mortality than BMI-defined obesity, particularly in the absence of central fat distribution.

In the model, community-acquired infection serves as a source of initial infection within households as well as of possible further cases. In addition, infected household members can infect others in the household. Maximum likelihood procedures for the model parameters are given. The model is fitted to symptom data on influenza and the common cold. Influenza seems to spread more easily in the community than within the household, while the opposite may be the case for the common cold. The model, which does not require specification of the time of onset of infection for individuals, can be fitted to serological data; this would provide a more accurate measure of household infection than the symptom data used.},

In particular, we assume that each node's conditional distribution is in the exponential family. We identify restrictions on the parameter space required for the existence of a well-defined joint density, and establish the consistency of the neighbourhood selection approach for graph reconstruction in high dimensions when the true underlying graph is sparse. Motivated by our theoretical results, we investigate the selection of edges between nodes whose conditional distributions take different parametric forms, and show that efficiency can be gained if edge estimates obtained from the regressions of particular nodes are used to reconstruct the graph. These results are illustrated with examples of Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson and exponential distributions. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by evidence from simulation studies.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an imaging method which enables a volume conductivity map of a subject to be produced from multiple impedance measurements. It has the potential to become a portable non-invasive imaging technique of particular use in imaging brain function. Accurate numerical forward models may be used to improve image reconstruction but, until now, have employed an assumption of isotropic tissue conductivity. This may be expected to introduce inaccuracy, as body tissues, especially those such as white matter and the skull in head imaging, are highly anisotropic. The purpose of this study was, for the first time, to develop a method for incorporating anisotropy in a forward numerical model for EIT of the head and assess the resulting improvement in image quality in the case of linear reconstruction of one example of the human head. A realistic Finite Element Model (FEM) of an adult human head with segments for the scalp, skull, CSF, and brain was produced from a structural MRI. Anisotropy of the brain was estimated from a diffusion tensor-MRI of the same subject and anisotropy of the skull was approximated from the structural information. A method for incorporation of anisotropy in the forward model and its use in image reconstruction was produced. The improvement in reconstructed image quality was assessed in computer simulation by producing forward data, and then linear reconstruction using a sensitivity matrix approach. The mean boundary data difference between anisotropic and isotropic forward models for a reference conductivity was 50{\%}. Use of the correct anisotropic FEM in image reconstruction, as opposed to an isotropic one, corrected an error of 24 mm in imaging a 10{\%} conductivity decrease located in the hippocampus, improved localisation for conductivity changes deep in the brain and due to epilepsy by 4-17 mm, and, overall, led to a substantial improvement on image quality. This suggests that incorporation of anisotropy in numerical models used for image reconstruction is likely to improve EIT image quality.},

abstract = {The Health Canada recommendation of 600 IU of vitamin D daily for those over age 70 may be inadequate to prevent deficiencies. A literature search was conducted to examine whether older people living in long-term care (LTC) facilities are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency and therefore should receive a minimum daily supplement of 800 IU. The search included the major databases; the search terms "elderly" and "vitamin D" were used. Articles primarily related to calcium were excluded. The results show that North American seniors generally consume a diet low in vitamin D and have limited sun exposure. The majority, particularly those living in LTC facilities, may have a vitamin D deficiency. Also contributing to deficiencies is an age-related decline in cutaneous production of vitamin D and altered metabolic processes responsible for converting vitamin D to its active form. In summary, research conducted in both Canada and the United States provides sufficient evidence to indicate that older people living in LTC facilities are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency and should receive a minimum daily supplement of 800 IU.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives The increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome necessitates the establishment of tools for evaluating dietary factors associated with visceral fat accumulation and preventing visceral fat obesity. Here, we aimed to develop a dietary factor assessment tool for evaluating visceral fat accumulation. Methods We conducted a dietary habit questionnaire survey and visceral fat measurement by bioelectrical impedance analysis in 11,438 adults (Survey 1) and a dietary habit questionnaire survey and dietary assessment based on 3-day meal records in 579 adults (Survey 2). Dietary habit factors were identified by factor analysis with varimax rotation, and their relationship with visceral fat accumulation and major nutrients were analyzed. Results Factor analysis of the dietary habit questionnaire revealed the following five main dietary factors: "Appetite (15 questions)," "Healthy food choice (5 questions)," "Sedentary behavior (6 questions)," "Calorie restriction (5 questions)," and "Irregular mealtime (4 questions)." "Appetite" correlated positively with visceral fat accumulation and energy intake mainly from carbohydrate. "Healthy food choice" correlated negatively with visceral fat accumulation and positively with the protein/fat ratio, dietary fiber/carbohydrate ratio, and N-3 fatty acid/fat ratio. Dietary guidance to modify excess energy intake and increase nutritional balance might be effective toward preventing visceral fat accumulation. Conclusions The dietary factor assessment tool developed in this study can be used to diagnose problems related to dietary habits and provide guidance for dietary modifications aimed at preventing visceral fat accumulation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To clarify the factors associated with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis, and to present the most recent information available in these areas. PARTICIPANTS From March 27-29, 2000, a nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel was convened, representing the fields of internal medicine, family and community medicine, endocrinology, epidemiology, orthopedic surgery, gerontology, rheumatology, obstetrics and gynecology, preventive medicine, and cell biology. Thirty-two experts from these fields presented data to the panel and an audience of 699. Primary sponsors were the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research. EVIDENCE MEDLINE was searched for January 1995 through December 1999, and a bibliography of 2449 references provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for presentations with relevant literature citations. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience. CONSENSUS PROCESS The panel, answering predefined questions, developed conclusions based on evidence presented in open forum and the literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read and circulated to the experts and the audience for public discussion. The panel resolved conflicts and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The draft statement was posted on the Web on March 30, 2000, and updated with the panel's final revisions within a few weeks. CONCLUSIONS Though prevalent in white postmenopausal women, osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages and has significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. Risks for osteoporosis (reflected by low bone mineral density [BMD]) and for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important but poorly validated role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing fracture risk, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation with these 2 nutrients may be necessary in persons not achieving recommended dietary intake. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce risk of falls in older persons. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary treatment goal for patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, including those that enhance bone mass and reduce the risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.},

abstract = {This contribution presents a new R package, called "compositions". It provides tools to analyze amount or compositional data sets in four different geometries, each one associated with an R class: rplus (for amounts, or open compositions, in a real, classical geometry), aplus (for amounts in a logarithmic geometry), rcomp (for closed compositions in a real geometry) and acomp (for closed compositions in a logistic geometry, following a log-ratio approach). The package allows to compare results obtained with these four approaches, since an analogous analysis can be performed according to each geometry, with minimal and straightforward modifications of the instructions. Beside these grounding classes, the package also includes: the most-basic features such as data transformations (e.g. logarithm, or additive logistic transform), basic statistics (both the classical ones, and those developed in the log-ratio framework of compositional analysis), high-level graphics (like ternary diagram matrix and scatter-plots) and high-level analysis (e.g. principal components or cluster analysis). Results of these functions and analysis are also provided in a consistent way among the four geometries, to ease their comparison. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective: Ectopic fat accumulation is associated with coronary artery disease. Visceral adipose tissue has paracrine and systemic effects and is a source of adipocytokines. It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis; however, nothing is known about whether increases in epicardial fat have the same effect on coronary atherosclerosis as increases in abdominal visceral fat. Methods: We examined 216 consecutive patients suspected to have coronary artery disease. Individuals with acute coronary syndrome and inadequate computed tomography (CT) imaging were excluded. We enrolled 164 patients (65±10 years old; 70{\%} men; body mass index [BMI], 23.8±3.6kg/m2). The plasma concentrations of adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor were measured. The characteristics of coronary plaque, abdominal visceral fat area, and epicardial fat volume (EFV) were determined by 64-slice CT imaging. Results: EFV was greater in subjects with noncalcified plaque than in those with no plaque or with calcified plaque (126±39mL vs. 98±34mL and 97±45mL, respectively; P=0.010). EFV was significantly correlated with BMI, triglycerides, and the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (r=0.51, 0.19, and 0.20, respectively) but not with plasma levels of adipocytokines. The plasma adiponectin and IL-6 concentration was significantly correlated with abdominal visceral fat area in coronary plaque patients (r=-0.49 and 0.20). Conclusions: In non-obese Japanese patients, epicardial fat may have unique mechanisms affecting the development of coronary atherosclerosis, which is different from abdominal visceral fat.},

Key findings of the study are that (a) substantial missing data is a serious problem that undermines the scientific credibility of causal conclusions from clinical trials; (b) the assumption that analysis methods can compensate for substantial missing data is not justified; hence (c) clinical trial design, including the choice of key causal estimands, the target population, and the length of the study, should include limiting missing data as one of its goals; (d) missing-data procedures should be discussed explicitly in the clinical trial protocol; (e) clinical trial conduct should take steps to limit the extent of missing data; (f) there is no universal method for handling missing data in the analysis of clinical trials – methods should be justified on the plausibility of the underlying scientific assumptions; and (g) when alternative assumptions are plausible, sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess robustness of findings to these alternatives.

abstract = {Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem. With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two simple experiments. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Until now, few clinical studies have reported on the association between the indexes of body fat distribution and serum ferritin, an indicator of body iron stores and a putative risk factor for insulin resistance. We investigated the association between serum ferritin concentrations and the indexes of distribution of adipose tissues in the body, such as the visceral fat area (VFA), the subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and the hepatic fat content in Japanese subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 248 Japanese subjects (127 men and 121 postmenopausal women aged 57.8 +/- 13.9 years, BMI 25.7 +/- 4.6 kg/m2; 140 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 108 nondiabetic subjects) were evaluated. Subjects with a history of alcohol intake were excluded from the study. We measured body height, body weight, and serum ferritin, as well as fasting plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations. We estimated insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment. The fat distribution was evaluated by measuring the VFA and SFA by abdominal computed tomography at the umbilical level. To assess the hepatic fat content, the ratio of the computed tomography attenuation value of the liver to that of the spleen was calculated. RESULTS: Serum ferritin was significantly correlated with the various indexes of adiposity examined, such as the hepatic fat content (r = -0.280, P {\textless} 0.0001), VFA (r = 0.254, P {\textless} 0.0001), SFA (r = 0.231, P = 0.0005), and homeostasis model assessment (r = 0.286, P = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to directly demonstrate an association between serum ferritin and VFA and SFA. The results of this study suggest that the serum ferritin concentration may be a useful indicator of systemic fat content and degree of insulin resistance.},

We performed a numerical investigation on bone remodeling after implantation of a specific short stemmed implant using finite element analysis (FEA). Overall bone mass loss was 2.8{\%} in the entire femur. Bone mass decrease was mostly found in the proximal part of the calcar and in the greater trochanter due to the vast cross section of the implant, probably leading to stress shielding. In the diaphysis, no change in the apparent bone density was proven. The assumptions made agreed well with bone remodeling data from THA recipients who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. However, the clinical investigation revealed a bone mass increase in the minor trochanter region that was less pronounced in the FEA. Further comparisons to other stem designs must be done to verify if the relative advantages of the investigated implant can be accepted.},

One clinical limitation of IRE is the absence of methods for real-time treatment evaluation, namely actively monitoring the dimensions of the induced lesion. This information is critical to ensure a complete treatment and minimize collateral damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nGOAL: In this study we are taking advantage of the biophysical properties of living tissues to address this critical demand.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using advanced microfabrication techniques, we have developed an electrical impedance micro-sensor to collect impedance data along the length of a bipolar IRE probe for treatment verification. For probe characterization and interpretation of the readings we used potato tuber, which is a suitable platform for IRE experiments without having the complexities of in vivo or ex vivo models. We used the impedance spectra, along with an electrical model of the tissue, to obtain critical parameters such as the conductivity of the tissue before, during, and after completion of treatment. To validate our results, we used a finite element model to simulate the electric field distribution during treatments in each potato.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: It is shown that electrical impedance spectroscopy could be used as a technique for treatment verification, and when combined with appropriate FEM modeling can determine the lesion dimensions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This technique has the potential to be readily translated for use with other ablation modalities already being used in clinical settings for the treatment of malignancies.},

The salt-reducing effect of the characteristic flavors other than umami of dried bonito stock, which is widely used in everyday Japanese food, was examined by sensory evaluation. In the 1st sensory evaluation, the effect was evaluated in a model solution. The saltiness of 0.80{\%} NaCl solution was equivalent to that of 0.12{\%} monosodium glutamate (MSG) solution containing 0.81{\%} NaCl and dried bonito stock containing 0.68{\%} NaCl. Saltiness enhancement could not be found when MSG solution was used, but was found with 6{\%} dried bonito stock. The 2nd evaluation examined whether the effect was valid for 2 everyday Japanese foods--traditional Japanese clear soup (sumashi-jiru) and steamed egg custard (tamagodoufu). Although enhancement of saltiness by dried bonito stock could not be clearly demonstrated in the soup, a change in NaCl concentration within 15{\%} did not affect the palatability of the soup. However, dried bonito stock not only enhanced the saltiness but also improved the palatability of steamed egg custard. These findings are expected to be useful for improving the palatability of salt-reduced food.},

Much research was done about the effect of adipokine to each organ and disease concept of metabolic syndrome was established that induces metabolic disorders and atherosclerotic diseases by dysregulation of adipokine following visceral fat accumulation. Also, role of adipokine in bone metabolism becomes clear gradually. In this review, former knowledge is outlined mainly about leptin and adiponectin.},

abstract = {Evidence supports that a high proportion of calories from protein increases weight loss and prevents weight (re)gain. Proteins are known to induce satiety, increase secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, and increase diet-induced thermogenesis, but less is known about whether various types of proteins exert different metabolic effects. In the Western world, dairy protein, which consists of 80{\%} casein and 20{\%} whey, is a large contributor to our daily protein intake. Casein and whey differ in absorption and digestion rates, with casein being a "slow" protein and whey being a "fast" protein. In addition, they differ in amino acid composition. This review examines whether casein, whey, and other protein sources exert different metabolic effects and targets to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Data indicate that whey is more satiating in the short term, whereas casein is more satiating in the long term. In addition, some studies indicate that whey stimulates the secretion of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide more than other proteins. However, for the satiety (cholecystokinin and peptide YY) and hunger-stimulating (ghrelin) hormones, no clear evidence exists that 1 protein source has a greater stimulating effect compared with others. Likewise, no clear evidence exists that 1 protein source results in higher diet-induced thermogenesis and promotes more beneficial changes in body weight and composition compared with other protein sources. However, data indicate that amino acid composition, rate of absorption, and protein/food texture may be important factors for protein-stimulated metabolic effects.},

abstract = {Several linkage studies have predicted that human chromosome 20q is closely related to type 2 diabetes, but there is no clear evidence that certain variant(s) or gene(s) have strong effects on the disease within this region. To examine disease susceptibility variant in Japanese, verified SNPs from the databases, with a minor allele frequency larger than 0.15, were selected at 10-kb intervals across a 19.31-Mb region (20q11.21-13.13), which contained 291 genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha). As a result, a total of 1,147 SNPs were genotyped with TaqMan assay using 1,818 Japanese samples. By searching for HNF4alpha as a representative disease-susceptible gene, no variants of HNF4alpha were strongly associated with disease. To identify other genetic variant related with disease, we designed an extensive two-stage association study (725 first and 1,093 second test samples). Although SNP1146 (rs220076) was selected as a landmark within the 19.31 Mb region, the magnitude of the nominal P value (P = 0.0023) was rather weak. Subsequently, a haplotype-based association study showed that two common haplotypes were weakly associated with disease. All of these tests resulted in non-significance after adjusting for Bonferroni's correction and the false discovery rate to control for the impact of multiple testing. Contrary to the initial expectations, we could not conclude that certain SNPs had a major effect on this promising locus within the framework presented here. As a way to extend our observations, we emphasize the importance of a subsequent association study including replication and/or meta-analysis in multiple populations.},

If exposure to a necessary agent is homogeneous within a population, then case/control and cohort methods will fail to detect it: they will only identify markers of susceptibility. The corresponding strategies in control are the 'high-risk' approach, which seeks to protect susceptible individuals, and the population approach, which seeks to control the causes of incidence. The two approaches are not usually in competition, but the prior concern should always be to discover and control the causes of incidence.},

It is well known, and now well accepted, that increases in exercise and loading of bone are associated with increased bone mass, and that disuse induces osteopenia. However, the mechanisms by which disuse leads to bone loss remain poorly understood, even in the 21st century. Clearly, the skeleton is able to perceive and respond to some general input(s) generated, or lost, as a consequence of mechanical unloading of bone that are distinct from habitual activity, so called functional adaptation. It is the focus of this paper to evaluate the evidence underlying roles for genetics, osteocytes, and interstitial fluid flow in mediating disuse osteopenia.},

abstract = {Obesity is a serious and growing public health problem in the United States and the world. While weight loss is associated with significant benefits in obesity-related co-morbidities, successful long-term weight loss maintenance is extremely difficult. This limited success is primarily due to biologic mechanisms that clearly favor weight regain. The weight-reduced state is associated with not only reductions in energy expenditure and changes in substrate metabolism but also in increased energy intake. Measures of appetite (increased hunger, reduced satiety) clearly change with weight loss. These changes in appetite may be mediated by alterations of peripheral appetite-related signals, such as leptin and meal-related gut peptides, promoting energy intake. Furthermore, significant changes in the neuronal response to food-related cues in the weight-reduced state have also been shown, stressing the importance of the interactions between homeostatic and non-homeostatic regulation of energy intake. In summary, the weight-reduced state is clearly associated with a dysregulation of energy balance regulation, resulting in a milieu promoting weight regain, and thus being one of the major obstacles of "treating" obesity and reducing its comorbidities. This paper will review the adaptations in the central regulation of energy intake that occur after weight-loss or in the weight-reduce state in humans, including changes in peripheral appetite-related signals and neuroimaging studies examining the brain's response to weight loss. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper presents an application of electrical resistance tomography (ERT) technique for the visualization of a thrombus in blood. Experiments were conducted in static and flowing bovine and swine blood samples. Artificially created thrombi were mixed in the blood samples for visualization. Eight-electrode tomography sensor was used for the measurement. Cross-sectional resistivity distribution was reconstructed using linear back projection algorithm. A thrombus was characterized by increased local resistivity. We successfully reconstructed the time, size and cross-sectional location of a thrombus, and reached a conclusion that the concentration and orientation of the RBCs in a thrombus contributed to the increase in the resistivity. The increment was relatively higher in the static blood than in flowing blood. These findings can be helpful in the development of an instrumentation system for the real-time monitoring of blood to visualize a thrombus. Developers of left ventricular assistance devices, heart-lung machines, hemodialyzer etc., and the end-users (i.e. patients) can greatly benefit from such a system.},

abstract = {Experimental animals that are trained to associate a cue with food consumption when hunger prevails will subsequently consume a greater amount of food when that cue is presented under conditions of satiety. Previously, we showed that this phenomenon of conditioned potentiation of feeding is abolished by a neurotoxic lesion that encompasses the basolateral (BL), basomedial (BM), and lateral (LA) nuclei of the amygdala (AMY) and by disconnection of this region and lateral hypothalamus (LHA). Here, we combined immediate-early gene (IEG) and tract-tracing methods to map functional AMY-LHA circuitry that is engaged when potentiated feeding is produced by pavlovian conditioning. Sated rats were assessed for food consumption in the presence of a cue that was paired previously with food (CS+), or in the presence of another cue that was never paired with food (CS-), in two consecutive tests temporally arranged for activation of the effector IEGs Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein) and Homer 1a. We examined the selective induction of the IEGs by tests with CS+ or CS- presentations in AMY neurons that project to LHA, as identified with the retrograde tracer FluoroGold. Using the same labeling methods, we also examined neurons in several other forebrain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, that receive strong inputs from BL/BM/LA nuclei and, in turn, innervate the LHA. Our results indicate that a cue that has acquired the ability to promote eating in sated rats (CS+) strongly activates a functional network formed by direct pathways from the BL/BM and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex to the LHA.},

The aim of the present study was to confirm the efficacy of orally administered bovine lactoferrin (bLF) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The patients with chronic hepatitis C randomly received either oral bLF at a dose of 1.8 g daily for 12 weeks, or an oral placebo. The primary endpoint was the virologic response, defined as a 50{\%} or greater decrease in serum HCV RNA level at 12 weeks compared with the baseline. The secondary endpoint was the biochemical response, which was defined as a 50{\%} or greater decrease in the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level at 12 weeks compared with the baseline. One hundred and ninetyeight of 199 patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety. bLF treatment was well tolerated and no serious toxicities were observed. A virologic response was achieved in 14 of 97 patients (14.4{\%}) in the bLF group, and 19 of 101 (18.8{\%}) in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in virologic response rates between the two groups (−4.4{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval −14.8, 6.1). In addition, bLF intake did not have any favorable effect on the serum ALT level. The virologic responses were not different between two groups in any subgroup analysis. In conclusion, orally administered bLF does not demonstrate any significant efficacy in patients with chronic hepatitis C.},

abstract = {SYNOPSIS The relationship between serum ferritin concentration and the amount of storage iron has been studied in normal subjects. A high degree of correlation was demonstrated between serum ferritin concentration and storage iron measured by quantitative phlebotomy. The possible advant-ages of assessing iron stores by using the serum ferritin concentration are discussed. Ferritin is the main iron storage compound in the body and is present mainly in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. A small amount is normally found in the circulating plasma, the concentration varying between 10 and 200,ug per litre (Jacobs, Miller, Worwood, Beamish, and Wardrop, 1972). The mean concentration in men is twice that in women suggesting that the serum level reflects total body stores. This is sup-ported by the observation that patients with iron-deficiency anaemia have concentrations below 10 ,.ug per litre and patients with iron overload have greatly increased levels (Jacobs et a!, 1972). Although there is a good correlation between serum ferritin concentration and iron load in pathological states there is no evidence that this correlation exists in normal subjects. The most accurate method for measuring iron stores is by quantitative phlebotomy (Haskins, Stevens, Finch, and Finch, 1952; Weinfeld, 1970). This gives a measure of the amount of iron available for haemoglobin synthesis, the so-called mobilizable iron stores. This paper reports on the relationship between iron stores in normal subjects measured by this method and serum ferritin concentration. jects gave their fully informed consent to this study. The group included 12 males aged 19 to 46 years and 10 females aged 22 to 40 years. Their haemato-logical characteristics (means and range) were as shown in table I.},

Methods After a 4-week pre-observation period, 150 overweight individuals(mean body mass index[BMI]±standard error of the mean[SEM], 27.21±1.28; mean age, 47.1±9.1 years)were divided into the catechin group, in which subjects consumed a tea catechin-rich beverage(540 mg tea catechins, 14 mg caffeine, 500 mL╱day), and the placebo group, in which subjects consumed a placebo beverage(0 mg tea catechins, 14 mg caffeine, 500 mL╱day), for 12 weeks, followed by another 4-week post-observation period. Results At week 12, the amount of change from baseline(week 0)in abdominal visceral fat area($\Delta$VFA), the primary endpoint, was significantly greater in the catechin group ($\Delta$VFA=－5.99±16.31 cm2)than in the placebo group($\Delta$VFA=0.30±17.56 cm2). Secondary endpoints, including total visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and body weight, were also significantly lower in the catechin group than in the placebo group. The incidence of adverse events and safety parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion Continuous consumption of the tea catechin-rich beverage for 12 weeks effectively decreased abdominal fat area and body weight with no side effects.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Lack of adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication is a major reason for poor control of hypertension worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of interventions to increase adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication. METHODS We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and searched for all-language publications in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in April 2002. RESULTS We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15 519 patients. The studies were conducted in 9 countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow-up ranged from 2 to 60 months. Because of heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in 7 of 9 studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8{\%} to 19.6{\%}. Motivational strategies were partly successful in 10 of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23{\%}. Complex interventions comparing more than 1 technique increased adherence in 8 of 18 studies, ranging from 5{\%} to a maximum of 41{\%}. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful. CONCLUSIONS Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure-lowering medication and should be tried as a first-line strategy, although there is so far less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising, but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed randomized controlled trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body electrical loss analysis (BELA) is a new non-invasive way to assess visceral fat depot size through the use of electromagnetism. BELA has worked well in phantom measurements, but the technology is not yet fully validated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Ten volunteers (5 men and 5 women, age: 22-60 y, BMI: 21-30 kg/m(2), waist circumference: 73-108 cm) were measured with the BELA instrument and with cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the navel level, navel +5 cm and navel -5 cm. The BELA signal was compared with visceral and subcutaneous fat areas calculated from the MR images.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The BELA signal did not correlate with subcutaneous fat area at any level, but correlated significantly with visceral fat area at the navel level and navel +5 cm. The correlation was best at level of navel +5 cm (R(2) = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.005, SEE = 29.7 cm(2), LOOCV = 40.1 cm(2)), where SEE is the standard error of the estimate and LOOCV is the root mean squared error of leave-one-out style cross-validation. The average estimate of repeatability of the BELA signal observed through the study was ±9.6 {\%}. One of the volunteers had an exceptionally large amount of visceral fat, which was underestimated by BELA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The correlation of the BELA signal with the visceral but not with the subcutaneous fat area as measured by MRI is promising. The lack of correlation with the subcutaneous fat suggests that subcutaneous fat has a minor influence to the BELA signal. Further research will show if it is possible to develop a reliable low-cost method for the assessment of visceral fat either using BELA only or combining it, for example, with bioelectrical impedance measurement. The combination of these measurements may help assessing visceral fat in a large scale of body composition. Before large-scale clinical testing and ROC analysis, the initial BELA instrumentation requires improvements. The accuracy of the present equipment is not sufficient for such new technology.},

abstract = {Research indicates that dysfunctional food reward processing may contribute to pathological eating behaviour. It is widely recognized that both the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are essential parts of the brain's reward circuitry. The aims of this fMRI study were (1) to examine the effects of food deprivation and calorie content on reward processing in the amygdala and the OFC, and (2) to examine whether an explicit evaluation of foods is necessary for OFC, but not amygdalar activity. Addressing the first aim, healthy females were presented with high and low calorie food pictures while being either hungry or satiated. For the second aim, attention focus was manipulated by directing participants' attention either to the food or to a neutral aspect. This study shows that hunger interacts with the energy content of foods, modulating activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, medial OFC, insula, caudate putamen and fusiform gyrus. Results show that satiated healthy females show an increased reward processing in response to low calorie foods. Confirming our hypothesis, food deprivation increased activity following the presentation of high calorie foods, which may explain why treatments of obesity energy restricting diets often are unsuccessful. Interestingly, activity in both the amygdala and mOFC was only evident when participants explicitly evaluated foods. However, attention independent activity was found in the mPFC following the high calorie foods cues when participants where hungry. Current findings indicate that research on how attention modulates food reward processing might prove especially insightful in the study of the neural substrates of healthy and pathological eating behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 681 individuals volunteered for this study (269 men, 412 women; age: 54.9 ± 14.3; body mass index [BMI]: 23.1 ± 3.3 kg/m2). Lateral lumbar radiographs were evaluated in each intervertebral section (L1/2 to L5/S1) using the Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KL). If at least one intervertebral section was graded as KL 2 or greater, the participants were considered to have LS. The summation of each section of intervertebral section was used as the radiographic severity value of LS. In addition, bone status was evaluated with an osteo-sono assessment index (OSI) at the calcaneus. Serum bone alkaline phosphatase ($\mu$g/mL), N-telopeptide of type I collagen (nMBCE/L), and pentosidine (pmol/mL) concentrations were examined and used as the bone metabolism index. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted with the radiographic severity value of LS as the dependent variable and age, sex, BMI, OSI, and the value of serum bone metabolic markers as the independent variables. The total number of LS participants was 470 (69.0 {\%}); the frequency of LS was higher in men (n = 198) than in women (n = 272; P = 0.036, $\chi$ 2 test). The mean severity value of LS was 7.1 ± 4.4, and the mean value of pentosidine was 120.7 ± 54.8 pmol/mL. On multiple regression analysis, age (B = 0.190, $\beta$ = 0.611), sex (men = 1, women = 2; B = -0.900, $\beta$ = -0.099), BMI (B = 0.185, $\beta$ = 0.136), and pentosidine (B = 0.009, $\beta$ = 0.115) were significantly correlated with the severity of LS.

DESIGN: The relations between sc and visceral adiposity and the cross-sectional dimensions and polar and principal moments of the femur in 100 healthy women ages 15 to 25 years were obtained using computed tomography. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that, after adjusting for leg length and thigh musculature, both sc and visceral fat had strong and independent associations with femoral cross-sectional area, cortical bone area, principal moment maximum, principal moment minimum, and polar moment (all P values {\textless} 0.03). However, whereas sc fat had a positive predictive value with all femoral bone phenotypes, a similar but negative effect was observed between visceral fat and these measures (all P values {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that visceral and sc fat have opposite effects on the appendicular skeleton; whereas sc fat is beneficial to bone structure and strength, visceral fat serves as an unique pathogenic fat depot.},

Here, we will describe the static reconstruction of an anisotropic conductivity distribution for the more realistic three-dimensional (3-D) case. Boundaries between different conductivity regions are anatomically constrained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The values of the conductivities are then determined using gradient-type algorithms in a nonlinear-indirect approach. At each iteration, the forward problem is solved by the finite element method. The approach is used to reconstruct the 3-D conductivity profile of a canine torso.

In particular, the use of an intracavity catheter to better extract interior conductivities is demonstrated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Equol is more biologically active than its precursor daidzein, which is the principal isoflavone found in soybean. There are interindividual differences in the ability to produce equol; these may lead to differences in the effects of isoflavone intervention on human health. This study aimed to investigate whether the effects of soy isoflavones on bone and fat mass are related to an individual's equol status. DESIGN We performed a 1-year double-blind, randomized trial to compare the effects of isoflavone (75 mg of isoflavone conjugates/day) with those of placebo on bone mineral density, fat mass, and serum isoflavone concentrations in early postmenopausal Japanese women who were classified based on their equol-producer phenotype. RESULTS After 1 year, the isoflavone intervention significantly increased the serum equol concentration in the equol producers but not in the nonproducers. In the isoflavone group, the annualized changes in the bone mineral density of the total hip and intertrochanteric regions were -0.46{\%} and -0.04{\%}, respectively, in the equol producers and -2.28{\%} and -2.61{\%}, respectively, in the nonproducers; these values were significantly different (P{\textless}0.05 for both the regions). Significant differences were observed between the equol producers and nonproducers in the isoflavone group with regard to the annualized changes in the fat mass. No significant difference in the annualized changes in bone mineral density and fat mass was observed between the equol producers and nonproducers in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the preventive effects of isoflavones on bone loss and fat accumulation in early postmenopausal women depend on an individual's equol-producing capacity.},

abstract = {Obesity is traditionally viewed to be beneficial to bone health because of well-established positive effect of mechanical loading conferred by body weight on bone formation, despite being a risk factor for many other chronic health disorders. Although body mass has a positive effect on bone formation, whether the mass derived from an obesity condition or excessive fat accumulation is beneficial to bone remains controversial. The underline pathophysiological relationship between obesity and bone is complex and continues to be an active research area. Recent data from epidemiological and animal studies strongly support that fat accumulation is detrimental to bone mass. To our knowledge, obesity possibly affects bone metabolism through several mechanisms. Because both adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from a common multipotential mesenchymal stem cell, obesity may increase adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation while decrease osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation. The increased circulating and tissue proinflammatory cytokines in obesity may promote osteoclast activity and bone resorption through modifying the receptor activator of NF-$\kappa$B (RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin pathway. Furthermore, the excessive secretion of leptin and/or decreased production of adiponectin by adipocytes in obesity may either directly affect bone formation or indirectly affect bone resorption through up-regulated proinflammatory cytokine production. Finally, high-fat intake may interfere with intestinal calcium absorption and therefore decrease calcium availability for bone formation. Unraveling the relationship between fat and bone metabolism at molecular level may help us to develop therapeutic agents to prevent or treat both obesity and osteoporosis. Obesity, defined as having a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2, is a condition in which excessive body fat accumulates to a degree that adversely affects health. The rates of obesity rates have doubled since 1980 and as of 2007, 33{\%} of men and 35{\%} of women in the US are obese. Obesity is positively associated to many chronic disorders such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers. It is estimated that the direct medical cost associated with obesity in the United States is {\~{}}{\$}100 billion per year.Bone mass and strength decrease during adulthood, especially in women after menopause. These changes can culminate in osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration resulting in increased bone fracture risk. It is estimated that there are about 10 million Americans over the age of 50 who have osteoporosis while another 34 million people are at risk of developing the disease. In 2001, osteoporosis alone accounted for some {\$}17 billion in direct annual healthcare expenditure. Several lines of evidence suggest that obesity and bone metabolism are interrelated. First, both osteoblasts (bone forming cells) and adipocytes (energy storing cells) are derived from a common mesenchymal stem cell and agents inhibiting adipogenesis stimulated osteoblast differentiation and vice versa, those inhibiting osteoblastogenesis increased adipogenesis. Second, decreased bone marrow osteoblastogenesis with aging is usually accompanied with increased marrow adipogenesis. Third, chronic use of steroid hormone, such as glucocorticoid, results in obesity accompanied by rapid bone loss. Fourth, both obesity and osteoporosis are associated with elevated oxidative stress and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. At present, the mechanisms for the effects of obesity on bone metabolism are not well defined and will be the focus of this review.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior research indicates that successful weight-loss maintainers (SWLs) work harder than people of normal weight to maintain their weight loss, including greater dietary restriction of fat and higher physical activity levels. However, little work to date has examined how SWLs differ biologically from normal-weight (NW) and obese controls. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the brain responses of SWLs to food pictures with those of NW and obese controls. DESIGN: Blood oxygen level-dependent responses to high- and low-energy food pictures were measured in 18 NW controls, 16 obese controls, and 17 SWLs. RESULTS: Group differences were identified in 4 regions, which indicated significant change in activation in response to the food pictures. SWLs showed greater activation in the left superior frontal region and right middle temporal region than did NW and obese controls-a pattern of results confirmed in exploratory voxel-wise analyses. Obese controls also showed greater activation in a bilateral precentral region. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SWLs show greater activation in frontal regions and primary and secondary visual cortices-a pattern consistent with greater inhibitory control in response to food cues and greater visual attention to the food cues. A greater engagement of inhibitory control regions in response to food cues as well as a greater monitoring of foods may promote control of food intake and successful weight-loss maintenance.},

We investigated the primary gustatory area (area G) precisely, and found it at the transition between the parietal operculum and the insular cortex. The central sulcus was activated less frequently than area G but with almost the same latency in cases of NaCl stimulation. Following area G, we found activation in several cortical regions, e.g. both the frontal operculum and the anterior part of the insula, the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus.},

abstract = {The neurotoxicity of a substance is often tested using animal bioassays. In the functional observational battery, animals are exposed to a test agent and multiple outcomes are recorded to assess toxicity, using approximately 40 animals measured on up to 30 different items. This design gives rise to a challenging statistical problem: a large number of outcomes for a small sample of subjects. We propose an exact test for multiple binary outcomes, under the assumption that the correlation among these items is equal. This test is based upon an exponential model described by Molenberghs and Ryan (1999, Environmetrics 10, 279-300) and extends the methods developed by Corcoran et al. (2001, Biometrics 57, 941-948) who developed an exact test for exchangeably correlated binary data for groups (clusters) of correlated observations. We present a method that computes an exact p-value testing for a joint dose-response relationship. An estimate of the parameter for dose response is also determined along with its 95{\%} confidence bound. The method is illustrated using data from a neurotoxicity bioassay for the chemical perchlorethylene.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The body fat reducing effect and reduction of risks for cardiovascular disease by a green tea extract (GTE) high in catechins was investigated in humans with typical lifestyles. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES Japanese women and men with visceral fat-type obesity were recruited for the trial. After a 2-week diet run-in period, a 12-week double-blind parallel multicenter trial was performed, in which the subjects ingested green tea containing 583 mg of catechins (catechin group) or 96 mg of catechins (control group) per day. Randomization was stratified by gender and body mass index at each medical institution. The subjects were instructed to maintain their usual dietary intake and normal physical activity. RESULTS Data were analyzed using per-protocol samples of 240 subjects (catechin group; n = 123, control group; n = 117). Decreases in body weight, body mass index, body fat ratio, body fat mass, waist circumference, hip circumference, visceral fat area, and subcutaneous fat area were found to be greater in the catechin group than in the control group. A greater decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found in the catechin group compared with the control group for subjects whose initial SBP was 130 mm Hg or higher. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was also decreased to a greater extent in the catechin group. No adverse effect was found. DISCUSSION The continuous ingestion of a GTE high in catechins led to a reduction in body fat, SBP, and LDL cholesterol, suggesting that the ingestion of such an extract contributes to a decrease in obesity and cardiovascular disease risks.},

abstract = {Objectives: Headaches and long working hours are important issues for workers. This study investigated the association between hours worked and the prevalence of headaches, and how that association varies with physical activity. Study design: Cross-sectional study with two-stage cluster sampling. Methods: Using data from a nationally representative sample of households in Japan, people aged 20-65 years who worked ≥35 h/week were studied, and the cross-sectional association between the number of hours worked per week (35-45, 46-55 and {\textgreater}55 h/week) and the prevalence rates of headaches of different severity was evaluated. Results: Of 721 workers, 307 reported experiencing at least one headache per month. Compared with working 35-45 h/week, the prevalence ratios of severe or disabling headaches among individuals working {\textgreater}55 h/week were 1.38 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.78] and 1.63 (95{\%} CI 1.09-2.43), respectively. After stratification by the level of physical activity, the prevalence ratios were greater in the low-physical-activity group: 1.56 (95{\%} CI 1.11-2.19) for severe headaches and 2.20 (95{\%} CI 1.31-3.68) for disabling headaches. The number of hours worked was not associated with headaches in the high-physical-activity group. Conclusions: Among workers in the general population, long working hours were associated with the prevalence of headaches, and the association may depend on a lack of physical activity. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society for Public Health.},

abstract = {Sensory-specific satiety, which is defined as a relative decrease in pleasantness, is increased by greater oro-sensory stimulation. Both sensory-specific satiety and pleasantness affect taste activation in the orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, metabolic satiety, which results from energy intake, is expected to modulate taste activation in reward areas. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the amount of oro-sensory stimulation and energy content on consumption-induced changes in taste activation. Ten men participated in a 2 × 2 randomized crossover study. Subjects were scanned twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging: after fasting for at least 2. h and after treatment, on four occasions. Treatment consisted of the ingestion of 450. mL of orangeade (sweetened with 10{\%} sucrose or non-caloric sweeteners) at 150. mL/min, with either small (5. mL) or large (20. mL) sips. During scanning, subjects alternately tasted orangeade, milk and tomato juice and rated its pleasantness. Before and after the scans, subjects rated pleasantness, prospective consumption, desire to eat and sweetness for all tastants. Main findings were that, before treatment, the amygdala was activated more by non-caloric than by caloric orangeade. Caloric orangeade activated part of the striatum before, but not after treatment. We observed no main effects of sip size on taste activation and no interaction between sip size and caloric content. In conclusion, the brain responds differentially to caloric and non-caloric versions of a sweet drink and consumption of calories can modulate taste activation in the striatum. Further research is needed to confirm that the observed differences are due to caloric content and not to (subliminal) differences in the sensory profile. In addition, implications for the effectiveness of non-caloric sweeteners in decreasing energy intake need to be established. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the neural mechanisms of reflex salivary secretion, experiments were carried out on anesthetized, decerebrate rats from which the volumes of submandibular salivary secretion and the efferent discharges in the preganglionic parasymapathetic fibers innervating the submandibular gland were recorded. Salivary secretion was induced by either infusing a taste solution, or an aliquot of hot water (45-55 degrees C) into the oral cavity, or by pinching the frontal parts of the oral region with a pair of forceps. The reflex salivation induced by noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli was markedly reduced by lesioning either the caudal (VC), or the interpolar (VI) trigeminal sensory nuclei. Taste-elicited salivary secretion was significantly reduced by lesioning the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). Of 43 preganglionic parasympathetic fibers sampled, 27 responded to both noxious mechanical and thermal stimulation of the oral region, and to electrical stimulation of the VC. Ten fibers responded only to taste stimulation and to electrical stimulation of the NTS. The remaining 6 fibers responded to both taste and noxious thermal stimulation of the oral region. These fibers responded well to NTS stimulation, but gave only a slight response to VC stimulation. These results suggest that two distinct neural pathways exist which mediate reflex salivation in the lower brain stem of the rat, i.e., the taste pathway via the NTS and the nociceptive pathway via the trigeminal sensory nuclei.},

abstract = {Aging reduces skeletal muscle mass and strength, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we used mouse models to investigate molecular mechanisms of age-related skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy as well as new potential interventions for these conditions. We identified two small molecules that significantly reduce age-related deficits in skeletal muscle strength, quality, and mass: ursolic acid (a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in apples) and tomatidine (a steroidal alkaloid derived from green tomatoes). Because small molecule inhibitors can sometimes provide mechanistic insight into disease processes, we used ursolic acid and tomatidine to investigate the pathogenesis of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. We found that ursolic acid and tomatidine generate hundreds of small positive and negative changes in mRNA levels in aged skeletal muscle, and the mRNA expression signatures of the two compounds are remarkably similar. Interestingly, a subset of the mRNAs repressed by ursolic acid and tomatidine in aged muscle are positively regulated by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Based on this finding, we investigated ATF4 as a potential mediator of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. We found that a targeted reduction in skeletal muscle ATF4 expression reduces age-related deficits in skeletal muscle strength, quality, and mass, similar to ursolic acid and tomatidine. These results elucidate ATF4 as a critical mediator of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. In addition, these results identify ursolic acid and tomatidine as potential agents and/or lead compounds for reducing ATF4 activity, weakness, and atrophy in aged skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {The Fitbit activity monitor is a consumer device for predicting energy expenditure (EE) and tracking activity patterns. To improve the EE estimation accuracy, Fitbit provides a web-based software program that allows a user to classify periods as distinct activities (based on the compendium of physical activities). However, the effect of this manual activity classification on EE estimation accuracy is not known.PURPOSE: To compare the EE prediction accuracy of the Fitbit before and after classifying activities.METHODS: Fifteen adults (7 male), 71.91(17.3) kg, 24.17(3.9) kg/m2, completed a four hour stay in a room calorimeter. Participants wore Fitbit on the right hip, and performed a series of randomly assigned activities/postures including supine, seated (quietly and using a computer), standing, walking, stepping, cycling, sweeping, and self-selected activities. We used the web-based software to classify each activity, and compared the estimated EE to the measured EE before and after activity classification. Image Tools RESULTS: Without activity classification, Fitbit significantly underestimated EE (368(18) vs. 499(24)kcal, mean(SE)). Classifying activities resulted in improved estimates of EE (516(13) vs. 499(24)kcal, mean(SE)). Root mean square error for non-classified EE was 136.7kcals (27.4{\%}) and was reduced to 64.25kcals (12.9{\%}) with activity classification. The non-classification estimates always underestimated EE, while the classified values were underestimated about half of the time, and were more accurate in all but two subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Fitbit is most accurate when the time is taken to classify the activities that were performed while wearing the device, though this may not be practical for the average consumer.},

abstract = {Objectives: Our purpose was to make a synthesis of the available evidence on the relative efficacy and safety of 2 drug-eluting stents (DES)-sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES)-in patients with coronary artery disease. Background: It is not known whether there are differences in late outcomes between the 2 most commonly used DES: SES and PES. Methods: Sixteen randomized trials of SES versus PES with a total number of 8,695 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A full set of individual outcome data from 5,562 patients was also available. Mean follow-up period ranged from 9 to 37 months. The primary efficacy end point was the need for reintervention (target lesion revascularization). The primary safety end point was stent thrombosis. Secondary end points were death and recurrent myocardial infarction (MI). Results: No significant heterogeneity was found across trials. Compared with PES, SES significantly reduced the risk of reintervention (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 0.87, p {\textless} 0.001) and stent thrombosis (HR 0.66; 95{\%} CI 0.46 to 0.94, p = 0.02) without significantly impacting on the risk of death (HR 0.92; 95{\%} CI 0.74 to 1.13, p = 0.43) or MI (HR 0.84; 95{\%} CI 0.69 to 1.03, p = 0.10). Conclusions: Sirolimus-eluting stents are superior to PES in terms of a significant reduction of the risk of reintervention and stent thrombosis. The risk of death was not significantly different between the 2 DES, but there was a trend toward a higher risk of MI with PES, especially after the first year from the procedure. {\textcopyright} 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {AIM: This study was designed to evaluate whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the bacterial population in supra/subgingival plaque. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-six healthy volunteers without severe periodontitis were randomized into two groups to receive lactobacilli or placebo for 8 weeks (8W): the test group (n=34) received 2.01 x 10(9) CFU/day of Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 and xylitol in tablets; the control group (n=32) received placebo with xylitol. Supra/subgingival plaque samples were collected at the baseline and after 4 weeks (4W) and 8W. The bacterial amounts in plaque samples were analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria in the test group was decreased significantly in subgingival plaque at 4W [odds ratio (OR)=3.13, 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI)=1.28-7.65, p=0.012]. Multivariate analysis showed that significantly higher odds were obtained for the reduction of Tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque of the test group at both 4W (OR=6.69, 95{\%} CI=2.51-17.9, p{\textless}0.001) and 8W (OR=3.67, 95{\%} CI=1.45-9.26, p=0.006).

OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to evaluate and summarize the existing literature investigating the relationships between qualitative aspects of diet, from single dietary components to overall dietary patterns, and VAT and SAAT. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Observational and controlled intervention studies that assessed healthy adults or adolescents using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or ultrasound were eligible for inclusion. After quality assessment of all eligible studies, 20 observational and 23 controlled intervention studies were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Considering study quality, including nutritional and abdominal adipose tissue assessment, about 30 caloric and noncaloric qualitative aspects of diet were found "to be associated with or affect" VAT and/or SAAT, most notably, medium-chain triacylglycerols, dietary fiber, calcium, phytochemicals, and dietary patterns; for fructose and alcohol, the relationships were less clear. CONCLUSION: Additional well-designed prospective studies are warranted to confirm current findings and to identify further qualitative aspects of diet that may influence VAT and SAAT accumulation.},

abstract = {Context: Regional fat is increasingly recognized as a determinant of bone mineral density (BMD), an association that may be mediated by adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, and inflammatory fat products. Chronic inflammation is deleterious to bone, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) predicts inflammatory markers such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin, whereas sc adipose tissue (SAT) and VAT predict IL-6 in adolescents. Objective: Our objective was to determine associations of regional fat mass and adipokines with BMD. We hypothesized that girls with greater VAT relative to SAT would have lower bone density mediated by inflammatory cytokines, adiponectin, and leptin. Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Setting: The study was conducted at a clinical research center. Subjects: Subjects included 30 girls (15 obese, 15 normal weight) 12-18 yr old, matched for maturity (bone age), race, and ethnicity. Outcome Measures: We assessed regional fat (SAT, VAT) using magnetic resonance imaging, total fat, and BMD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Fasting leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were obtained. Results: Mean body mass index sd score was 3.7 +/- 1.5 in obese subjects and 0.1 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2) in controls. VAT was a negative predictor of spine BMD and bone mineral apparent density, whole-body BMD and bone mineral content/height in obese girls and whole-body BMD and bone mineral content/height for the group as a whole after controlling for SAT, as was the ratio of VAT to SAT. In a regression model that included VAT/SAT, adipokines, and cytokines, E-selectin and adiponectin were negative predictors of BMD and leptin a positive predictor. Conclusion: VAT is an independent inverse determinant of bone density in obesity. This association may be mediated by adipokines and a chronic inflammatory state.},

In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanisms of sake yeast to induce sleep by monitoring locomotor activity, electromyogram and electroencephalogram in mice. Oral administration of Japanese sake yeast (100, 200, and 300 mg kg(-1) ) decreased the locomotor activity by 18, 46 and 59{\%} and increased the amount of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep by 1.5-, 2.3- and 2.4-fold (to 37 ± 6, 57 ± 8, and 60 ± 4 min from 25 ± 6 min in the vehicle-administered group, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner for 4 h after oral administration. However, Japanese sake yeast did not change the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the electroencephalogram power density during NREM sleep or show any adverse effects, such as rebound of insomnia, during 24 h postadministration and on the next day. An intraperitoneal pretreatment with an adenosine A2A receptor-selective antagonist, ZM241385 (15 mg kg(-1) ), reduced the amount of NREM sleep of sake yeast-administered mice to the basal level, without changing basal amount of sleep. Conversely, an A1 receptor-selective antagonist, 8-cyclopentyltheophylline (10 mg kg(-1) ), did not affect the sleep-promoting effect of Japanese sake yeast. Thus, Japanese sake yeast promotes NREM sleep via activation of adenosine A2A but not A1 receptors.},

It reports that both the boundary voltage values and the associated sensitivity matrix of an alternative sensing strategy can be derived from a set of full independent measurements and sensitivity matrix obtained from other sensing strategy. A new sensing method for regional imaging with limited measurements is reported. It also proves that the sensitivity coefficient back-projection algorithm does not always work for all sensing strategies, unless the diagonal elements of the transformed matrix, ATA, have significant values and can be approximate to a diagonal matrix. Imaging capabilities of few sensing strategies were verified with static set-ups, which suggest the adjacent electrode pair sensing strategy displays better performance compared with the diametrically opposite protocol, with both the back-projection and multi-step image reconstruction methods. An application of electrical impedance tomography for sensing gas in water two-phase flows is demonstrated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis article is part of the themed issue ‘Supersensing through industrial process tomography'.},

Such an energy balance framework is a potentially powerful tool for investigating the regulation of body weight. However, we need a better un- derstanding of the components of energy balance and their in- teractions over various time scales to explain the natural history of conditions such as obesity and to estimate the magnitude and potential success of therapeutic interventions. Therefore, the ASN and the International Life Sciences Institute convened a panel composed of members with expertise in weight manage- ment, energy metabolism, physical activity, and behavior to reviewthe published scientific literature and to hear presentations from other experts in these fields. The Consensus Panel met 9–12 May 2011 in Chicago, IL, and was charged to provide answers to the following 5 questions: 1. Explain energy balance and imbalance in terms of a biolog- ical system in which energy intake and energy expenditure change over time in response to the environment. 2. What are the interactions between the components of en- ergy balance and how are they regulated? 3. What is the veracity of some of the popular beliefs related to energy balance? 4. What limitations do we face in the study of energy balance and its components? 5. What research would better inform our knowledge of en- ergy balance and its components?},

abstract = {Both bone mass and serum leptin levels are increased in obesity. Because osteoblasts and adipocytes arise from a common precursor in bone marrow, we assessed the effects of human recombinant leptin on a conditionally immortalized human marrow stromal cell line, hMS2– 12, with the potential to differentiate to either the osteoblast or adi-pocyte phenotypes. By RT-PCR and Western immunoblot analysis, the hMS2–12 cells expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein for the leptin receptor. Leptin did not affect hMS2–12 cell proliferation, but resulted in dose-and time-dependent increases in mRNA and protein levels of alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, and osteocal-cin, and in a 59{\%} increase in mineralized matrix. Leptin increased mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase at 3 days, but decreased mRNA levels of adipsin and leptin at 9 days and decreased lipid droplet formation by 50{\%}. Leptin did not affect the expression of Cbfa1 or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-␥ 2 , transcription factors involved in commitment to the osteoblast and adipocyte pathways, respectively. Thus, leptin acts on human marrow stromal cells to enhance osteoblast differentiation and to inhibit adipocyte differen-tiation. Our data support the hypothesis that leptin is a previously unrecognized, physiological regulator of these two differentiation pathways, acting primarily on maturation of stromal cells into both lineages.},

abstract = {Context: The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) are well known to be associated with hypertension. However, the extent of the effects is not yet well elucidated in general conditions. Objective: To separately determine the effect of the HPA axis and the RAAS on hypertension in a general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based study of 859 Japanese individuals enrolled in the 2014 Iwaki study and without hypertension or steroid treatment (age, 50.2 = 14.7 years). Main Outcome Measures: Hypertension prevalence, plasma concentration of aldosterone, ACTH, cortisol, and plasma renin activity. Results: Principal component (PC) analysis using these four hormones identified two PCs (PC1 and PC2), which represent levels of these hormones as a whole, and dominance between the HPA axis (ACTH and cortisol) and the RAAS (plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of aldosterone), respectively. Association between these PCs and hypertension was significant (PC1, high vs low, odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.02; and PC2, HPA axis vs RAAS dominancy, OR, 2.08; and 95{\%} CI, 1.51-2.85). However, association between the hormone levels as a whole and hypertension became insignificant after adjustment for multiple factors including these PCs together. However, association between the HPA axis dominance and hypertension remained significant even after the adjustment (the HPA axis vs the RAAS, OR, 1.73; 95{\%} CI, 1.20-2.48). Conclusions: The HPA axis dominance over the RAAS is significantly associated with hypertension in a Japanese population. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Endocrine Society.},

abstract = {We recently discovered an unexpected phenomenon of somatic cell reprogramming into pluripotent cells by exposure to sublethal stimuli, which we call stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP). This reprogramming does not require nuclear transfer or genetic manipulation. Here we report that reprogrammed STAP cells, unlike embryonic stem (ES) cells, can contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues, as seen in a blastocyst injection assay. Mouse STAP cells lose the ability to contribute to the placenta as well as trophoblast marker expression on converting into ES-like stem cells by treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In contrast, when cultured with Fgf4, STAP cells give rise to proliferative stem cells with enhanced trophoblastic characteristics. Notably, unlike conventional trophoblast stem cells, the Fgf4-induced stem cells from STAP cells contribute to both embryonic and placental tissues in vivo and transform into ES-like cells when cultured with LIF-containing medium. Taken together, the developmental potential of STAP cells, shown by chimaera formation and in vitro cell conversion, indicates that they represent a unique state of pluripotency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The risk of chronic disease cannot be predicted simply by the content of a single nutrient in a food or food group in the diet. The contribution of food sources of calories, added sugars and saturated fat (SFA) to intakes of dietary fiber and micronutrients of public health importance is also relevant to understanding the overall dietary impact of these foods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: Identify the top food sources of calories, added sugars and SFA in the U.S. diet and quantify their contribution to fiber and micronutrient intakes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Single 24-hour dietary recalls (Day 1) collected from participants ≥2 years (n = 16,822) of the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (WWEIA/NHANES 2003-2006) were analyzed. All analyses included sample weights to account for the survey design. Calorie and nutrient intakes from foods included contributions from disaggregated food mixtures and tabulated by rank order.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No one food category contributes more than 7.2{\%} of calories to the overall U.S. diet, but half of the top 10 contribute 10{\%} or more of total dietary fiber and micronutrients. Three of the top 10 sources of calories and SFA (beef, milk and cheese) contribute 46.3{\%} of the calcium, 49.5{\%} of the vitamin D, 42.3{\%} of the vitamin B12 as well as other essential nutrients to the American diet. On the other hand, foods categorized as desserts, snacks, or beverages, contribute 13.6{\%} of total calories, 83{\%} of added sugar intake, and provide little or no nutritional value. Including food components of disaggregated recipes more accurately estimated the contribution of foods like beef, milk or cheese to overall nutrient intake compared to "as consumed" food categorizations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Some food sources of calories, added sugars and SFA make major contributions to American dietary fiber and micronutrient intakes. Dietary modifications targeting reductions in calories, added sugar, or SFA need to take these key micronutrient sources into account so as not to have the unintended consequence of lowering overall dietary quality.},

abstract = {It is desirable to adjust Spearman's rank correlation for covariates, yet existing approaches have limitations. For example, the traditionally defined partial Spearman's correlation does not have a sensible population parameter, and the conditional Spearman's correlation defined with copulas cannot be easily generalized to discrete variables. We define population parameters for both partial and conditional Spearman's correlation through concordance-discordance probabilities. The definitions are natural extensions of Spearman's rank correlation in the presence of covariates and are general for any orderable random variables. We show that they can be neatly expressed using probability-scale residuals (PSRs). This connection allows us to derive simple estimators. Our partial estimator for Spearman's correlation between X and Y adjusted for Z is the correlation of PSRs from models of X on Z and of Y on Z, which is analogous to the partial Pearson's correlation derived as the correlation of observed-minus-expected residuals. Our conditional estimator is the conditional correlation of PSRs. We describe estimation and inference, and highlight the use of semiparametric cumulative probability models, which allow preservation of the rank-based nature of Spearman's correlation. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our estimators and compare them with other popular measures of association, demonstrating their robustness and efficiency. We illustrate our method in two applications, a biomarker study and a large survey.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography of brain function poses special problems because applied current is diverted by the resistive skull. In the past, image resolution was maximized with the use of an electrode addressing protocol with widely spaced drive electrode pairs and use of a multiplexer so that many electrode pairs could be flexibly addressed. The purpose of this study was to develop and test an electrode protocol for a 16-channel semi-parallel system which uses parallel recording channels with fixed wiring, the Kyung Hee University (KHU) Mk1. Ten protocols were tested, all addressing pairs of electrodes for recording or current drive, based on recording with a spiral, spiral with suboccipital electrodes (spiral s-o) and zig-zag configurations, and combinations of current injection from electrode pairs at 180 degrees , 120 degrees and 60 degrees . These were compared by assessing the image reconstruction quality of five simulated perturbations in a homogenous model of the human head and of four epileptic foci in an anatomically realistic model in the presence of realistic noise, in terms of localization error, resolution, image distortion and sensitivity in the region of interest. The spiral s-o with current injection at 180 degrees + 120 degrees + 60 degrees gave the best image quality and permitted reconstruction with a localization error of less than 10{\%} of the head diameter. This encourages the view that it might be possible to obtain satisfactory images of focal abnormalities in the human brain with 16 scalp electrodes and improved instrumentation avoiding multiplexers on recording circuits.},

The reproduction number, that is, the average number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case, was estimated as a function of time and according to different types of hosts.Results A total of five superspreaders were identified. The reproduction number throughout the course of the outbreak was estimated at 1.0 due to reconstruction of the transmission tree, while the variance of secondary cases generated by a primary case was 52.1. All of the superspreaders involved in this outbreak appeared to have generated a substantial number of contacts in multiple healthcare facilities (association: p{\textless}0.01), generating on average 4.0 (0.0–8.6) and 28.6 (0.0–63.9) secondary cases among patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities and others. The time-dependent reproduction numbers declined substantially below the value of 1 on and after 13 June 2015.Conclusions Superspreaders who visited multiple facilities drove the epidemic by generating a disproportionate number of secondary cases. Our findings underscore the need to limit the contacts in healthcare settings. Contact tracing efforts could assist early laboratory testing and diagnosis of suspected cases.},

abstract = {We performed successive H215O-PET scans on volunteers as they ate chocolate to beyond satiety. Thus, the sensory stimulus and act (eating) were held constant while the reward value of the chocolate and motivation of the subject to eat were manipulated by feeding. Non-specific effects of satiety (such as feelings of fullness and autonomic changes) were also present and probably contributed to the modulation of brain activity. After eating each piece of chocolate, subjects gave ratings of how pleasant/unpleasant the chocolate was and of how much they did or did not want another piece of chocolate. Regional cerebral blood flow was then regressed against subjects' ratings. Different groups of structures were recruited selectively depending on whether subjects were eating chocolate when they were highly motivated to eat and rated the chocolate as very pleasant [subcallosal region, caudomedial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula/operculum, striatum and midbrain] or whether they ate chocolate despite being satiated (parahippocampal gyrus, caudolateral OFC and prefrontal regions). As predicted, modulation was observed in cortical chemosensory areas, including the insula and caudomedial and caudolateral OFC, suggesting that the reward value of food is represented here. Of particular interest, the medial and lateral caudal OFC showed opposite patterns of activity. This pattern of activity indicates that there may be a functional segregation of the neural representation of reward and punishment within this region. The only brain region that was active during both positive and negative compared with neutral conditions was the posterior cingulate cortex. Therefore, these results support the hypothesis that there are two separate motivational systems: one orchestrating approach and another avoidance behaviours.},

abstract = {Estimation of vaccine efficacy has traditionally focused on the reduction in susceptibility to infection, or the vaccine efficacy for susceptibility (VES). However, a vaccine, such as a prophylactic HIV vaccine, may also lower the infectiousness of a vaccinated person who became infected. The relative reduction in infectiousness due to vaccination is the vaccine efficacy for infectiousness (VEI). Estimation of VEI is challenging because it requires information on exposure to infection, and gathering this type of information is often expensive and difficult, or even impossible. Household studies are expected to provide more information on who is exposed to whom. In a previous paper, we developed a method for estimating VES and VEI from a household study where only the final outbreak data are available. However, the resulting estimates were quite unstable. In this work, we develop a survival model for the estimation of VES and VEI from household data where the time of infection is known for every study participant. Using stochastic simulations, we show that the proposed method significantly reduces the bias and mean square error in the estimation of both VES and VEI as compared to the method based on final outbreak data. We also show that when time-to-event data are available, a household study produces more robust estimators than a same-size study of unrelated individuals. In addition, we investigate the bias in estimating VES and VEI due to misclassification of infection status when only illness data, rather than true infection data, are available.

OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was primarily conducted to evaluate the precise effects of soy isoflavones on lipid profiles. The effects of soy protein that contains enriched and depleted isoflavones were also examined. DESIGN: PUBMED was searched for English-language reports of randomized controlled trials published from 1990 to 2006 that described the effects of soy protein intake in humans. Eleven studies were selected for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Soy isoflavones significantly decreased serum total cholesterol by 0.10 mmol/L (3.9 mg/dL or 1.77{\%}; P = 0.02) and LDL cholesterol by 0.13 mmol/L (5.0 mg/dL or 3.58{\%}; P {\textless} 0.0001); no significant changes in HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol were found. Isoflavone-depleted soy protein significantly decreased LDL cholesterol by 0.10 mmol/L (3.9 mg/dL or 2.77{\%}; P = 0.03). Soy protein that contained enriched isoflavones significantly decreased LDL cholesterol by 0.18 mmol/L (7.0 mg/dL or 4.98{\%}; P {\textless} 0.0001) and significantly increased HDL cholesterol by 0.04 mmol/L (1.6 mg/dL or 3.00{\%}; P = 0.05). The reductions in LDL cholesterol were larger in the hypercholesterolemic subcategory than in the normocholesterolemic subcategory, but no significant linear correlations were observed between reductions and the starting values. No significant linear correlations were found between reductions in LDL cholesterol and soy protein ingestion or isoflavone intakes. CONCLUSIONS: Soy isoflavones significantly reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol but did not change HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol. Soy protein that contained enriched or depleted isoflavones also significantly improved lipid profiles. Reductions in LDL cholesterol were larger in hypercholesterolemic than in normocholesterolemic subjects.},

abstract = {Background {\&} aims: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has been shown to be profoundly responsible of most of the obesity-associated metabolic derangements. The measurement of VAT usually implies the use of imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT). Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of the determination of VAT by means of abdominal bioimpedance (BIA) with the ViScan device in comparison with CT and its clinical usefulness in the management of obesity. Methods: We studied a sample of 140 subjects (73 males/67 females) with BMI ranging from 17.7 to 50.4 kg/m2to evaluate the accuracy of the ViScan in comparison to CT to determine VAT. To further analyze ViScan's clinical usefulness we studied a separate cohort (n = 2849) analyzing cardiometabolic risk factors. Furthermore, we studied the ability of the ViScan to detect changes in VAT after weight gain (n = 107) or weight loss (n = 335). The study was performed from October 2009 through June 2015. Results: ViScan determines VAT with a good accuracy in individuals with a CT-VAT up to 200 cm2, and then with lower precision with increasing body mass, exhibiting a moderate–high correlation with CT-VAT (r = 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001). Importantly, VAT determination with the ViScan exhibits better correlations with several cardiometabolic risk factors such as glucose, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and markers of fatty liver than anthropometric measurements such as BMI or waist circumference. ViScan is able to detect VAT variations after body weight changes. Conclusions: Since the possibility of measuring VAT by imaging techniques is not always available, abdominal BIA represents a good alternative to estimate VAT, allowing the identification of patients with increased VAT-related cardiometabolic risk and a better management of obese patients.

abstract = {The primary visual cortex (V1) in congenitally blind humans has been shown to be involved in tactile discrimination tasks, indicating that there is a shift in function of this area of cortex, but the age dependency of the reorganization is not fully known. To investigate the reorganized network, we measured the change of regional cerebral blood flow using 3.0 Tesla functional MRI during passive tactile tasks performed by 15 blind and 8 sighted subjects. There was increased activity in the postcentral gyrus to posterior parietal cortex and decreased activity in the secondary somatosensory area in blind compared with sighted subjects during a tactile discrimination task. This suggests that there is a greater demand for shape discrimination processing in blind subjects. Blind subjects, irrespective of the age at onset of blindness, exhibited higher activity in the visual association cortex than did sighted subjects. V1 was activated in blind subjects who lost their sight before 16 years of age, whereas it was suppressed in blind subjects who lost their sight after 16 years of age during a tactile discrimination task. This suggests that the first 16 years of life represent a critical period for a functional shift of V1 from processing visual stimuli to processing tactile stimuli. Because of the age.dependency, V1 is unlikely to be the "entry node" of the cortex for the redirection of tactile signals into visual cortices after blinding. Instead, the visual association cortex may mediate the circuitry by which V1 is activated during tactile stimulation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the familiality and heritability of binge eating disorder (BED). METHOD: We used a new ACE structural equation model to estimate heritability from a case-control family study of BED conducted in the Boston area. The sample consisted of 150 overweight/obese probands with lifetime BED by DSM-IV criteria, 150 overweight/obese probands without lifetime BED, and 888 of their first-degree relatives. We compared our findings with those from a study of binge eating (in the absence of compensatory behaviors) among 7,831 Norwegian twins. RESULTS: The prevalence of BED differed by sex and by age. In the case-control family study, BED was found to aggregate in families, and heritability was estimated as 57{\%} (CI: 30-77{\%}). Including shared environment did not substantially improve the model's fit, nor did allowing sex-specific heritability. Findings from the twin study were similar. CONCLUSION: BED appears to aggregate in families and have a significant genetic component.},

abstract = {One of the most frequently used deterministic models in spatial interpolation is the inverse-distance weighting (IDW) method. It is relatively fast and easy to compute, and straightforward to interpret. Its general idea is based on the assumption that the attribute value of an unsampled point is the weighted average of known values within the neighborhood, and the weights are inversely related to the distances between the prediction location and the sampled locations. The inverse-distance weight is modified by a constant power or a distance-decay parameter to adjust the diminishing strength in relationship with increasing distance. Recognizing the potential of varying distance-decay relationships over the study area, we suggest that the value of the weighting parameter be allowed to vary according to the spatial pattern of the sampled points in the neighborhood. This adaptive approach suggests that the distance-decay parameter can be a function of the point pattern of the neighborhood. We developed an algorithm to search for "optimal" adaptive distance-decay parameters. Using cross validation to evaluate the results, we conclude that adaptive IDW performs better than the constant parameter method in most cases, and better than ordinary kriging in one of our empirical studies when the spatial structure in the data could not be modeled effectively by typical variogram functions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Several dietary patterns emerged. The dietary$\backslash$npatterns with the most variation were labeled "Western," "prudent,"$\backslash$n"high fat/sugar dairy," "substituters," and "drinkers." The "Western"$\backslash$ndietary pattern was associated with a higher body mass index and$\backslash$na greater intake of total energy and dietary cholesterol. The "prudent"$\backslash$npattern was associated with higher levels of vigorous leisure time$\backslash$nphysical activity, smaller body size, and higher intakes of dietary$\backslash$nfiber and folate. Persons who had high scores on the "drinker" pattern$\backslash$nwere also more likely to smoke cigarettes. The "Western" dietary$\backslash$npattern was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer in$\backslash$nboth men and women. The association was strongest among people diagnosed$\backslash$nprior to age 67 years (for men, odds ratio (OR)=1.96, 95{\%} confidence$\backslash$ninterval (CI) 1.22-3.15; for women, OR=2.02, 95{\%} CI 1.21-3.36) and$\backslash$namong men with distal tumors (OR=2.25, 95{\%} CI 1.47-3.46).

abstract = {The primate orbitofrontal cortex is a site of convergence of information from primary taste, olfactory and somatosensory cortical areas. We describe the discovery of a population of single neurons in the macaque orbitofrontal cortex that responds to the temperature of a liquid in the mouth. The temperature stimuli consisted of water at 10°C, 23°C, 37deg;C and 42°C. Twenty-six of the 1149 neurons analyzed (2.3{\%}) responded to oral temperature. The tuning profiles of the neurons to temperature showed that some of the neurons had graded responses to increasing temperature (27{\%}), others responded to cold (10°C) stimuli (27{\%}), and others were tuned to temperature (46{\%}). The neuronal responses were also measured to taste stimuli, viscosity stimuli (carboxymethyl-cellulose in the range 1-10,000 cP), and capsaicin (10 $\mu$M). Of 70 neurons with responses to any of these stimuli, 7.1{\%} were unimodal temperature; 11.3{\%} were temperature and taste-sensitive; 7.1{\%} were temperature and viscosity-sensitive; and 11.3{\%} were temperature, taste and viscosity sensitive. Capsaicin activated 15.7{\%} of the population of responsive neurons tested. These results provide the first evidence of how the temperature of what is in the mouth is represented at the neuronal level in the orbitofrontal cortex and the first evidence for any primate cortical area that in some cases this information converges onto single neurons with inputs produced by other sensory properties of food, including taste and texture. The results provide a basis for understanding how particular combinations of oral temperature, taste, and texture can influence the palatability of foods. {\textcopyright} 2004 IBRO.

abstract = {Influenza vaccination is recommended as the best way to protect against influenza infection and illness. Due to seasonal changes in influenza virus types and subtypes, a new vaccine must be produced, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) must be estimated, annually. Since 2010, influenza vaccination has been recommended universally in the United States, making randomized clinical trials unethical. Recent studies have used a monitored household cohort study design to determine separate VE estimates against influenza transmission from the household and community. We developed a probability model and accompanying maximum likelihood procedure to estimate vaccine-related protection against transmission of influenza from the household and the community. Using agent-based stochastic simulations, we validated that we can obtain maximum likelihood estimates of transmission parameters and VE close to their true values. Sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of deviations from our assumptions were conducted. We used our method to estimate transmission parameters and VE from data from a monitored household study in Michigan during the 2012-2013 influenza season and were able to detect a significant protective effect of influenza vaccination against community-acquired transmission.},

Toxic proteases from the bacterium called gingipains were also identified in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, and levels correlated with tau and ubiquitin pathology. Oral P. gingivalis infection in mice resulted in brain colonization and increased production of A$\beta$ 1–42 , a component of amyloid plaques. Further, gingipains were neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro, exerting detrimental effects on tau, a protein needed for normal neuronal function. To block this neurotoxicity, we designed and synthesized small-molecule inhibitors targeting gingipains. Gingipain inhibition reduced the bacterial load of an established P. gingivalis brain infection, blocked A$\beta$ 1–42 production, reduced neuroinflammation, and rescued neurons in the hippocampus. These data suggest that gingipain inhibitors could be valuable for treating P. gingivalis brain colonization and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Optimal acquisition of bone mass in puberty is a key determinant of the lifetime risk of osteoporosis and has a strong genetic basis. We investigated the relationship between the COL1A1 Sp1 polymorphism and BMD in early puberty, and how the genotypes relate to bone size and geometry as well as bone turnover and material properties in 247 10- to 13-year-old girls. Bone properties were measured using DXA, pQCT, and ultrasound. Also, serum P1NP, OC, B-ALP, and TRACP 5b were assessed. Our results showed that girls with the TT genotype had significantly lower BMC and BMD of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur, as well as BUA at the calcaneus, than those with the GT and GG genotype. They also had significantly lower B-ALP, as well as P1NP/TRACP 5b and (OC + B-ALP)/TRACP 5b, compared to the others. These findings indicate that the COL1A1 polymorphism is associated with low bone properties in early puberty and suggest a possible physiological effect on collagen metabolism and bone turnover. This information may contribute to the identification of children at risk for suboptimal acquisition of peak bone mass and may ultimately be of value in the planning of early preventive strategies for osteoporosis.},

The cohort consisted of 12561 men and 15 301 women residing in Takayama, Japan, in 1992. At the baseline, a food frequency questionnaire was administered; and the dietary GI, GL, and intake of carbohydrates and rice were estimated. Deaths from stroke occurring in the cohort were prospectively noted until 1999 with data from the office of the National Vital Statistics. The risk of mortality from stroke was assessed with a Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age; body mass index; smoking status; physical activity; history of hypertension; education; and intake of total energy, alcohol, dietary fiber, salt, and total fat. The risk of stroke subtypes was assessed in the age-adjusted model. The hazard ratios of total stroke comparing the highest vs the lowest quartiles of the dietary GI were 0.78 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.41-1.47) with Ptrend = .50 in men and 2.09 (95{\%} CI, 1.01-4.31) with Ptrend = .10 in women. Among women, the association was also significant with the risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio = 2.45; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-5.92; Ptrend = .03); and a significant positive trend was also observed between dietary GL and mortality from hemorrhagic stroke (Ptrend = .05). The current study implies that diets with a high dietary GI increase the risk of mortality from stroke among Japanese women. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Red berries of a tropical plant called miracle fruit, Richadella dulcifica, reduce the sour and aversive taste of acids and add sweet and palatable taste. To elucidate the brain mechanism of this unique action of miracle fruit, we recorded taste-elicited magnetic fields of the human cerebral cortex. The initial taste responses were localized in the fronto-parietal opercular/insular cortex reported as the primary taste area. The mean latency of the response to citric acid after chewing miracle fruit was essentially the same as that for sucrose and was 250-300??ms longer than that for citric acid. Since it is known that stimulation with acids after the action of miracle fruit induces both sweetness and sourness responses in the primate taste nerves, the present results suggest that the sourness component of citric acid is greatly diminished at the level of subcortical relays, and mostly sweetness information reaches the cortical primary taste area. We propose the idea that the qualitative aspect of taste is processed in the primary taste area and the affective aspect is represented by the pattern of activation among the different cortical areas. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This study examined the effect of energy density, independent of fat content and palatability, on food and energy intakes. With use of a within-subjects design, normal-weight women (n = 18) were provided with meals for 2 d during each of three test sessions. During lunch, dinner, and an evening snack, subjects were given free access to a main entree varying in energy density (low, medium, or high). The manipulated main entrees were similar in palatability to their counterparts across conditions. Low-energy compulsory (consumption required) side dishes accompanied each meal. Subjects also consumed a standard, compulsory breakfast. Results showed that subjects consumed a similar amount of food (by weight) across the three conditions of energy density. Thus, significantly more energy was consumed in the condition of high energy density (7532 +/- 363 kJ, or 1800 +/- 86 kcal) than in the medium- (6356 +/- 281 kJ, or 1519 +/- 67 kcal) and low- (5756 +/- 178 kJ, or 1376 +/- 43 kcal) energy-density conditions (P {\textless} 0.0001). There were no differences in hunger or fullness before meals, after meals, or over the 2 d across conditions. The results from this study indicate that energy density affects energy intake independent of macronutrient content or palatability, suggesting that the overconsumption of high-fat foods may be due to their high energy density rather than to their fat content.},

abstract = {A capacitive sensing method was developed for sensing surface electromyographic potential (sEMG) through a thin cloth. The method is based on capacitive coupling involving fabric electrodes, the cloth, and the skin of the subject. A proposed measuring device was assembled by modifying the previously developed instrument for electrocardiographic potential. Experimental results showed that sEMG obtained with the proposed system was clearly visible and showed firings synchronized with sEMG simultaneously measured with a commercial device and that the spectral powers of both sEMGs were almost identical. These results demonstrated the potential of the proposed method to measure sEMG through cloth. The method enables the discomfort due to conventional skin-to-electrode coupling to be eliminated, although the signal quality, such as the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), is slightly decreased with the cloth barrier.},

abstract = {Energy homeostasis is maintained locally through parenchymal-stromal cell interaction and systemically through metabolic organ network. In obese adipose tissue, saturated fatty acids, which are released as a danger signal from hypertrophied adipocytes, stimulates a pathogen sensor TLR4 in the infiltrating macrophages, thus establishing a vicious cycle between adipocytes and macrophages to stimulate adipose tissue inflammation. Histologically, macrophages aggregate to constitute crown-like structures (CLS), where they are thought to scavenge the residual lipid droplets of dead adipocytes. Free fatty acids, when released from obese visceral fat depots, are transported in large quantities to the liver via the portal vein, where they are accumulated as ectopic fat, thus developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is a unique histological feature termed÷hepatic CLS (hCLS){\o}in the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver, where macrophages aggregate to surround dead hepatocytes with large lipid droplets. Notably, the number of hCLS is positively correlated with the extent of liver fibrosis. Our data suggest that hCLS serves as an origin of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis during the progression from simple steatosis to NASH. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, an oral antidiabetic drug, promotes the urinaryexcretion of glucose by blocking its reabsorption in renal proximal tubules. Inhibition of SGLT2 lowers is expected to reduce body weight because of urinary calorie loss. Interestingly, SGLT2 inhibition improves hepatic steatosis in obese mice irrespective of body weight reduction. There is an inverse correlation between liver weight and adipose tissue weight in obese mice with SGLT2 inhibition, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibition induces the÷healthy{\o}adipose tissue expansion and prevents ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. Our data suggest that seeing both the wood and trees is Required to understand the molecular mechanism of lifestyle-related diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The purposes of this study were to reveal the prevalence of locomotive syndrome (LS) evaluated by loco-check in the Japanese general population and to analyze the relationship between radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA) and lumbar spondylosis, metabolic syndrome and LS. Furthermore, we evaluated LS according to functional examinations. METHODS Seven hundred twenty-two volunteers aged 56.6 ± 13.6 years participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in 2010 and were classified into two groups: LS (one or more disabilities) or non-LS (no disability) according to the criteria of LS proposed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Radiographic knee OA and lumbar spondylosis were defined according to the Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of two or more risk factors in addition to visceral obesity. The prevalence of LS associated with knee OA, lumbar spondylosis and metabolic syndrome was compared statistically. Also, data of six functional examinations were compared between the non-LS and LS groups. RESULTS The prevalence of LS was 21.2 {\%} in males and 35.6 {\%} in females and increased with aging regardless of gender. The prevalence of LS with knee OA was 48.7 {\%}, with lumbar spondylosis was 33.8 {\%}, and with metabolic syndrome was 43.4 {\%}. The non-LS group had significantly better performance in the functional reach and sit and reach tests than the LS group in males and females by age-adjusted comparison. CONCLUSION The prevalence of LS in the general population was higher in females than in males. A strong risk factor for LS was radiographic knee OA. Also, those with LS had loss of skeletal muscle mass, balancing and flexibility. This study showed that evaluation by loco-check was an acceptable tool to detect the early stage of locomotive disability for LS, and interventional prevention for strength, balancing and flexibility would be helpful for those with LS.},

We prospectively investigated the association of low-carbohydrate diet score with type 2 diabetes risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Participants were 27,799 men and 36,875 women aged 45-75 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study and who had no history of diabetes. Dietary intake was ascertained by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and low-carbohydrate diet score was calculated from total carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake. The scores for high animal protein and fat or for high plant protein and fat were also calculated. Odds ratios of self-reported, physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over 5-year were estimated by using logistic regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the 5-year period, 1191 new cases of type 2 diabetes were self-reported. Low-carbohydrate diet score for high total protein and fat was significantly associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in women (P for trend {\textless}0.001); the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of type 2 diabetes for the highest quintile of the score were 0.63 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.46-0.84), compared with those for the lowest quintile. Additional adjustment for dietary glycemic load attenuated the association (odds ratio 0.75, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.45-1.25). When the score separated for animal and for plant protein and fat, the score for high animal protein and fat was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in women, whereas the score for high plant protein and fat was not associated in both men and women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Low-carbohydrate diet was associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in Japanese women and this association may be partly attributable to high intake of white rice. The association for animal-based and plant-based low-carbohydrate diet warrants further investigation.},

As a result, statistical methods and models are being developed in this area at a furious pace, with contributions coming from a wide spectrum of disciplines. This book provides an up-to-date treatment of the foundations common to the statistical analysis of network data across the disciplines. The material is organized according to a statistical taxonomy, although the presentation entails a conscious balance of concepts versus mathematics. In addition, the examples—including extended cases studies—are drawn widely from the literature.

abstract = {Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants to determine whether an observational association between a risk factor and an outcome is consistent with a causal effect.1 Mendelian randomization relies on the natural, random assortment of genetic variants during meiosis yielding a random distribution of genetic variants in a population.1 Individuals are naturally assigned at birth to inherit a genetic variant that affects a risk factor (eg, a gene variant that raises low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol levels) or not inherit such a variant. Individuals who carry the variant and those who do not are then followed up for the development of an outcome of interest. Because these genetic variants are typically unassociated with confounders, differences in the outcome between those who carry the variant and those who do not can be attributed to the difference in the risk factor. For example, a genetic variant associated with higher LDL cholesterol levels that also is associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease would provide supportive evidence for a causal effect of LDL cholesterol on coronary heart disease.},

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the fundamentals of EIT and demonstrate the principles of mechanical ventilation, lung recruitment, and EIT imaging on a comprehensive physiological model, which combines a model of respiratory mechanics, a model of the human lung absolute resistivity as a function of air content, and a 2-D finite-element mesh of the thorax to simulate EIT image reconstruction during mechanical ventilation. The overall model gives a good understanding of respiratory physiology and EIT monitoring techniques in mechanically ventilated patients. The model proposed here was able to reproduce consistent images of ventilation distribution in simulated acutely injured and collapsed lung conditions. A new advisory system architecture integrating a previously developed data-driven physiological model for continuous and noninvasive predictions of blood gas parameters with the regional lung function data/information generated from absolute EIT (aEIT) is proposed for monitoring and ventilator therapy management of critical care patients.},

We suggest that, as with other regions of the prefrontal cortex, activity in the OFC is most likely to be observed when there is insufficient information available to determine the appropriate course of action. In these circumstances the OFC, rather than other prefrontal regions, is more likely to be activated when the problem of what to do next is best solved by taking into account the likely reward value of stimuli and responses, rather than their identity or location. We suggest that selection of stimuli on the basis of their familiarity and responses on the basis of a feeling of 'rightness' are also examples of selection on the basis of reward value. Within the OFC, the lateral regions are more likely to be involved when the action selected requires the suppression of previously rewarded responses.},

abstract = {Background High plasma HDL cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction, but whether this association is causal is unclear. Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodified by disease processes, mendelian random isation can be used to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal. Methods We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20 913 myocardial infarction cases, 95 407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that exclusively associate with HDL cholesterol and tested this score in up to 12 482 cases of myocardial infarction and 41 331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol. Findings Carriers of the LIPG 396Ser allele (2{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} frequency) had higher HDL cholesterol (0{\textperiodcentered}14 mmol/L higher p=8×10-13) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with noncarriers. This difference in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13{\%} (odds ratio [OR] 0{\textperiodcentered}87, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}84-0{\textperiodcentered}91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}88-1{\textperiodcentered}11, p=0{\textperiodcentered}85). From observational epidemiology, an increase of 1 SD in HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}62, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}58-0{\textperiodcentered}66). However, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}93 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}68-1{\textperiodcentered}26, p=0{\textperiodcentered}63). For LDL cholesterol, the estimate from observational epidemiology (a 1 SD increase in LDL cholesterol associated with OR 1{\textperiodcentered}54, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}45-1{\textperiodcentered}63) was concordant with that from genetic score (OR 2{\textperiodcentered}13 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}69-2{\textperiodcentered}69, p=2×10-10). Interpretation Some genetic mechanisms that raise plasma HDL cholesterol do not seem to lower risk of myocardial infarction. These data challenge the concept that raising of plasma HDL cholesterol will uniformly translate into reductions in risk of myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {Various bootstraps have been proposed for bootstrapping clustered data from one-way arrays. The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To determine by how much statins reduce serum concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and incidence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) events and stroke, according to drug, dose, and duration of treatment. DESIGN Three meta-analyses: 164 short term randomised placebo controlled trials of six statins and LDL cholesterol reduction; 58 randomised trials of cholesterol lowering by any means and IHD events; and nine cohort studies and the same 58 trials on stoke. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Reductions in LDL cholesterol according to statin and dose; reduction in IHD events and stroke for a specified reduction in LDL cholesterol. RESULTS Reductions in LDL cholesterol (in the 164 trials) were 2.8 mmol/l (60{\%}) with rosuvastatin 80 mg/day, 2.6 mmol/l (55{\%}) with atorvastatin 80 mg/day, 1.8 mmol/l (40{\%}) with atorvastatin 10 mg/day, lovastatin 40 mg/day, simvastatin 40 mg/day, or rosuvastatin 5 mg/day, all from pretreatment concentrations of 4.8 mmol/l. Pravastatin and fluvastatin achieved smaller reductions. In the 58 trials, for an LDL cholesterol reduction of 1.0 mmol/l the risk of IHD events was reduced by 11{\%} in the first year of treatment, 24{\%} in the second year, 33{\%} in years three to five, and by 36{\%} thereafter (P {\textless} 0.001 for trend). IHD events were reduced by 20{\%}, 31{\%}, and 51{\%} in trials grouped by LDL cholesterol reduction (means 0.5 mmol/l, 1.0 mmol/l, and 1.6 mmol/l) after results from first two years of treatment were excluded (P {\textless} 0.001 for trend). After several years a reduction of 1.8 mmol/l would reduce IHD events by an estimated 61{\%}. Results from the same 58 trials, corroborated by results from the nine cohort studies, show that lowering LDL cholesterol decreases all stroke by 10{\%} for a 1 mmol/l reduction and 17{\%} for a 1.8 mmol/l reduction. Estimates allow for the fact that trials tended to recruit people with vascular disease, among whom the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction on stroke is greater because of their higher risk of thromboembolic stroke (rather than haemorrhagic stroke) compared with people in the general population. CONCLUSIONS Statins can lower LDL cholesterol concentration by an average of 1.8 mmol/l which reduces the risk of IHD events by about 60{\%} and stroke by 17{\%}.},

abstract = {Objective Although caloric restriction is a widely used intervention to reduce body weight and insulin resistance, many patients are unable to comply with such dietary therapy for long periods. The clinical effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets was recently described in a position statement of Diabetes UK and a scientific review conducted by the American Diabetes Association. However, randomised trials of dietary interventions in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes are scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of a non-calorie-restricted, low-carbohydrate diet in Japanese patients unable to adhere to a calorie-restricted diet. Methods The enrolled patients were randomly allocated to receive a conventional calorie-restricted diet or low-carbohydrate diet. The patients received consultations every two months from a registered dietician for six months. We compared the effects of the two dietary interventions on glycaemic control and metabolic profiles. Results The HbA1c levels decreased significantly from baseline to six months in the low-carbohydrate diet group (baseline 7.6+/-0.4{\%}, six months 7.0+/-0.7{\%}, p=0.03) but not in the calorie-restricted group (baseline 7.7+/-0.6{\%}, six months 7.5+/-1.0{\%}, n.s.), (between-group comparison, p=0.03). The patients in the former group also experienced improvements in their triglyceride levels, without experiencing any major adverse effects or a decline in the quality of life. Conclusion Our findings suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet is effective in lowering the HbA1c and tri-glyceride levels in patients with type 2 diabetes who are unable to adhere to a calorie-restricted diet. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.},

abstract = {Umami taste stimuli, of which an exemplar is monosodium glutamate (MSG) and which capture what is described as the taste of protein, were shown using functional MRI (fMRI) to activate similar cortical regions of the human taste system to those activated by a prototypical taste stimulus, glucose. These taste regions included the insular/opercular cortex and the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex. A part of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was also activated. When the nucleotide 0.005 M inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) was added to MSG (0.05 M), the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal in an anterior part of the orbitofrontal cortex showed supralinear additivity; this may reflect the subjective enhancement of umami taste that has been described when IMP is added to MSG. These results extend to humans previous studies in macaques showing that single neurons in these taste cortical areas can be tuned to umami stimuli.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether polymorphisms G1704T and G82S of the rage gene were related to diabetic retinopathy, we performed a case-control study in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes were examined for polymorphisms G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene. The genotypes of G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene were determined with a fluorescent allele-specific DNA primer assay system. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was diagnosed in a masked manner by independent ophthalmologists using fundus photographs and was classified as non-diabetic retinopathy (NDR), non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative retinopathy (PDR). RESULTS: The T allele frequency of G1704T and S allele frequency of G82S in patients with DR did not significantly differ from those without retinopathy. There were no differences among the genotypes of G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene regarding age, duration of diabetes, BMI, HbA(1c), blood pressure, and lipids levels. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that polymorphisms G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene are not related to DR in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine reproducibility and validity of visual analogue scales (VAS) for measurement of appetite sensations, with and without a diet standardization prior to the test days. DESIGN: On two different test days the subjects recorded their appetite sensations before breakfast and every 30 min during the 4.5 h postprandial period under exactly the same conditions. SUBJECTS: 55 healthy men (age 25.6AE AE0.6 y, BMI 22.6AE AE0.3 kga am 2). MEASUREMENTS: VAS were used to record hunger, satiety, fullness, prospective food consumption, desire to eat something fatty, salty, sweet or savoury, and palatability of the meals. Subsequently an ad libitum lunch was served and energy intake was recorded. Reproducibility was assessed by the coef{\textregistered}cient of repeatability (CR) of fasting, mean 4.5 h and peakanadir values. RESULTS: CRs (range 20 ± 61 mm) were larger for fasting and peaka anadir values compared with mean 4.5 h values. No parameter seemed to be improved by diet standardization. Using a paired design and a study power of 0.8, a difference of 10 mm on fasting and 5 mm on mean 4.5 h ratings can be detected with 18 subjects. When using desires to eat speci{\textregistered}c types of food or an unpaired design, more subjects are needed due to considerable variation. The best correlations of validity were found between 4.5 h mean VAS of the appetite parameters and subsequent energy intake (r  AE AE0.50 ± 0.53,.001). CONCLUSION: VAS scores are reliable for appetite research and do not seem to be in¯uenced by prior diet standardization. However, consideration should be given to the speci{\textregistered}c parameters being measured, their sensitivity and study power.},

Here we show that this dependence is more complicated when acquisition and severity of illness are determined by the size of the infecting dose, as is thought to be the case for measles and varicella. Two alternative formulations for the way vaccination changes an individual's susceptibility and infectivity show that vaccination coverage, the nature of the vaccine response and the distribution of household size also have a big impact on which strategy is more effective. These judgements are made by comparing the post-vaccination reproduction numbers corresponding to different vaccination strategies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Though the overall prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing in US and in all other westernized countries, significant differences are noted among different ethnic groups. The reasons for ethnic differences in the risk of type 2 diabetes are not entirely understood. For example, Asian Indians (people from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) have remarkably high prevalence of type 2 diabetes compared to Caucasians. However, the incidence of obesity, an important risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes, is significantly lower in Asian Indians compared to Caucasians. Though westernization of lifestyle with dietary changes and lack of exercise may play a role in increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in migrant Asian Indians, various epidemiological studies have shown that these factors alone are not sufficient to explain this trend. One important factor contributing to increased type 2 diabetes in Asian Indians is excessive insulin resistance compared to Caucasians. This difference in the degree of insulin resistance may be explained by either an environmental or a genetic factor or by combination of both. The understanding of the etiology and mechanisms causing increased insulin resistance in Asian Indians will provide clues to more effective prevention and treatment of diabetes in this ethnic group. Furthermore, the information may help in understanding the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in other ethnic groups and improve methods of treatment and prevention in all ethnic groups. Since the ethnic mix of the US population is changing rapidly and it is estimated that by the year 2020, over 50{\%} of US population will include non-Caucasian ethnicity, the identification of the mechanism involved in the excessive development of type 2 diabetes in non-Caucasians becomes important. In this review, possible etiology of excessive insulin resistance and role of free fatty acids (FFA) in insulin resistance in Asian Indians is discussed. Finally, the role of targeting insulin resistance in prevention and treatment of diabetes is discussed. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nutrition is an important "modifiable" factor in the development and maintenance of bone mass and in the prevention of osteoporosis. The improvement of calcium intake in prepuberal age translates to gain in bone mass and, with genetic factor, to achievement of Peak Bone Mass (PBM), the higher level of bone mass reached at the completion of physiological growth. Individuals with higher PBM achieved in early adulthood will be at lower risk for developing osteoporosis later in life. Achieved the PBM, it is important maintain the bone mass gained and reduce the loss. This is possible adopting a correct behaviour eating associated to regular physical activity and correct life style. The diet is nutritionally balanced with caloric intake adequate to requirement of individual. This is moderate in protein (1 g/kg/die), normal in fat and the carbohydrates provide 55-60{\%} of the caloric intake. A moderate intake of proteins is associated with normal calcium metabolism and presumably does'nt alter bone turnover. An adequate intake of alkali-rich foods may help promote a favorable effect of dietary protein on the skeleton. Lactose intolerance may determinate calcium malabsorption or may decrease calcium intake by elimination of milk and dairy products. Omega3 fatty acids may "down-regulate" pro-inflammatory cytokines and protect against bone loss by decreasing osteoclast activation and bone reabsorption. The diet is characterized by food containing high amount of calcium, potassium, magnesium and low amount of sodium. If it is impossible to reach the requirement with only diet, it is need the supplement of calcium and vitamin D. Other vitamins (Vit. A, C, E, K) and mineral (phosphorus, fluoride, iron, zinc, copper and boron) are required for normal bone metabolism, thus it is need adequate intake of these dietary components. It is advisable reduce ethanol, caffeine, fibers, phytic and ossalic acid intake. The efficacy of phytoestrogens is actually under investigation. Some drugs may interfere with calcium and other nutrients and produce an unfavourable effect on bone health.},

Electronic and nonelectronic searches were conducted to identify relevant articles, with no restrictions in time or language. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. Five eligible trials were identified, and three of these were included. All studies were associated with a high risk of bias. The meta-analytic result reveals a significant difference in body weight in GCE compared with placebo (mean difference: kg; 95{\%}CI: , ). The magnitude of the effect is moderate, and there is significant heterogeneity amongst the studies. It is concluded that the results from these trials are promising, but the studies are all of poor methodological quality. More rigorous trials are needed to assess the usefulness of GCE as a weight loss tool.},

abstract = {Initial reports of emotion recognition in Huntington's disease (HD) found disproportionate impairments in recognising disgust. Not all subsequent studies have found this pattern, and a review of the literature to date shows that marked impairments in recognising anger are also often seen in HD. However, the majority of studies have based their conclusions on a single test of facial expression recognition. In the current study we revisit this issue of emotion recognition in HD to address whether the pattern found on one test of facial expression recognition generalised to another, and to different modalities using tests of emotion recognition from facial expressions, vocal expressions, and short verbal vignettes. The results showed evidence of impairments in recognising anger, fear and disgust across the three domains, with recognition of anger the most severely impaired. Given work identifying different subtypes of disgust that are associated with different facial features, a second study examined the recognition of three disgust expressions that healthy participants reliably associate with unpleasant tastes, unpleasant smells, and a more general elaborated or expanded form of disgust that includes reactions to violations of moral standards. The results showed a disproportionate impairment in recognising faces associated with the expanded form, the subtype most closely aligned with anger. We conclude that the related emotions of disgust and anger associated with social disapproval are frequently impaired in HD and discuss factors that might cause one emotion to show more severe impairments than the other. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background : For a given blood pressure, the risk of death from coronary artery disease is much higher in northern Europe and the United States than in Mediterranean countries. Objective : In this prospective cohort study, we tested the hypothesis that regular wine drinking reduces the hypertension-related risk of death. Design : We used data from 36 583 healthy middle-aged men who had normal results on an electrocardiogram and were not taking drugs for cardiovascular disease risk factors. The subjects underwent a comprehensive health appraisal at the Center for Preventive Medicine between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1985. Mortality from all causes and from specific causes during a 13-21-y follow-up was recorded. Results : In a Cox model adjusted for 6 confounding variables, moderate wine drinkers (those who consumed {\textless}60 g alcohol/d and no beer) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 158, 139, or 116 mm Hg had significantly lower risks of death from all causes by 23{\%}, 27{\%}, and 37{\%}, respectively, than did abstainers. Even for the highest quartile of blood pressure, moderate wine drinkers were protected from all-cause mortality. No significant reduction in all-cause mortality in relation to SBP was observed in other drinkers (those who consumed {\textgreater} or =60 g alcohol/d or who consumed beer and wine). Conclusion : A moderate intake of wine is associated with a lower risk of mortality from all causes in persons with hypertension.},

abstract = {A moderately detailed 3-D finite element model of the conductive anatomy of a canine thorax was used to examine the sensitivity of the results obtained during simulated transthoracic defibrillation to variations in skeletal muscle anisotropy and differing degrees of model inhomogeneity. Our results suggest that the myocardial current density distribution is not particularly sensitive to the method used to model skeletal muscle anisotropy. However, anisotropy variations caused defibrillation parameters such as paddle to paddle impedance and threshold current to change by as much as 50{\%}. We found a greater sensitivity in the myocardial current density and the defibrillation parameters to variations in model inhomogeneity. The changes observed in both depended substantially on paddle placement. This sensitivity to paddle placement highlights the difficulty in predicting how a reduction in anatomical detail will affect the myocardial current density distribution. In general, we found the defibrillation parameters to be more sensitive than the myocardial current density distribution to the variations in anatomical detail we examined.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Whether testosterone treatment has benefits on body composition over and above caloric restriction in men is unknown. We hypothesised that testosterone treatment augments diet-induced loss of fat mass and prevents loss of muscle mass. METHODS We conducted a randomised double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled trial at a tertiary referral centre. A total of 100 obese men (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) with a total testosterone level of or below 12 nmol/L and a median age of 53 years (interquartile range 47-60) receiving 10 weeks of a very low energy diet (VLED) followed by 46 weeks of weight maintenance were randomly assigned at baseline to 56 weeks of 10-weekly intramuscular testosterone undecanoate (n = 49, cases) or matching placebo (n = 51, controls). The main outcome measures were the between-group difference in fat and lean mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and visceral fat area (computed tomography). RESULTS A total of 82 men completed the study. At study end, compared to controls, cases had greater reductions in fat mass, with a mean adjusted between-group difference (MAD) of -2.9 kg (-5.7 to -0.2; P = 0.04), and in visceral fat (MAD -2678 mm2; -5180 to -176; P = 0.04). Although both groups lost the same lean mass following VLED (cases -3.9 kg (-5.3 to -2.6); controls -4.8 kg (-6.2 to -3.5), P = 0.36), cases regained lean mass (3.3 kg (1.9 to 4.7), P {\textless} 0.001) during weight maintenance, in contrast to controls (0.8 kg (-0.7 to 2.3), P = 0.29) so that, at study end, cases had an attenuated reduction in lean mass compared to controls (MAD 3.4 kg (1.3 to 5.5), P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS While dieting men receiving placebo lost both fat and lean mass, the weight loss with testosterone treatment was almost exclusively due to loss of body fat.

abstract = {Mechanical properties of bone are determined not only by bone mineral density (BMD), but also by tissue trabecular structure and organic composition. Impedance spectroscopy has shown potential to diagnose trabecular bone BMD and strength, however, the relationships between organic composition and electrical and dielectric properties have not been systematically investigated. To investigate these issues organic composition of 26 human trabecular bone samples harvested from the distal femur and proximal tibia was determined and compared with relative permittivity, loss factor, conductivity, phase angle, specific impedance and dissipation factor measured at wide range (50 Hz to 5 MHz) of frequencies. A strong linear correlation was found between the relative permittivity at 1.2 MHz and trabecular bone fat content (r = -0.85, p {\textless} 0.01, n = 26). On the other hand, relative permittivity measured at 200 Hz served as a good predictor of water content (r = 0.83). Phase angle, specific impedance and especially conductivity were strongly related to the trabecular bone dry density and water content (|r| ≥ 0.69). Variation in bone tissue collagen content was strongly related to the relative permittivity measured at 1.2 MHz (r = 0.64), but only moderately to other parameters. Glycosaminoglycan content showed no significant relations with any investigated electrical parameters. The present study indicates that if the trabecular bone composition is known, the relationships presented in this study could facilitate calculation of current field distribution, e.g. during electrical stimulation of osteogenesis. On the other hand, our results suggest that permittivity measured at low ({\textless}1 kHz) or high ({\textgreater}100 kHz) frequencies could be used, e.g. during implant surgery, for prediction of trabecular bone water or fat contents, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 IPEM.},

abstract = {In trabecular bone, the interrelationships of electrical and dielectric properties with mechanical characteristics are poorly known. Information on these relations is crucial for evaluation of the diagnostic potential of impedance techniques. In this study, electrical and dielectric properties, i.e. permittivity, conductivity, phase angle, loss factor, specific impedance and dissipation factor of human trabecular bone samples (n=26, harvested from the distal femur and proximal tibia) were characterized in a wide frequency range (50 Hz-5 MHz). Mechanical properties, i.e. Young's modulus, ultimate strength, yield stress, yield strain and resilience of the samples (n=20) were determined by using destructive compressive testing. Subsequently, measurements of electrical and dielectric properties were repeated after mechanical testing. The measurements were also repeated for the control samples (n=6) that were not mechanically tested. Electrical, dielectric or mechanical properties showed no significant differences between the intact femoral and tibial samples. The electrical and dielectric parameters as well as the linear correlations between the dielectric and electrical parameters with mechanical parameters were strongly frequency dependent. At the frequency of 1.2 MHz, the relative permittivity showed the strongest linear correlations with the Young's modulus (r=0.71, p{\textless}0.01, n=20) and ultimate strength (r=0.73, p{\textless}0.01, n=20). Permittivity and dissipation factor showed statistically significant changes after mechanical testing. Our results suggest that the measurements of low frequency electrical and dielectric properties may provide information on the mechanical status of trabecular bone and, possibly, may even help to diagnose bone microdamage. In the future, these measurement techniques may be further developed for use during open surgery, such as bone grafting or total hip replacement surgery.},

abstract = {Making an accurate estimate of quality distribution in a granite deposit is essential, both from a financial point of view, to determine the profitability of the site, and from an environmental perspective, to focus operations on the most profitable areas thereby reducing the ext0065nt of land affected by such work. Granite is extracted in blocks whose profitability and value depend on the final size of the slabs, which is an important factor in defining quality. This article uses a variant of disjunctive kriging in order to determine the quality of granite in one of the largest reserves in the world-the Porri{\~{n}}o deposit located in northwest Spain. This method, unlike classical disjunctive kriging, considers random variables that are not necessarily binary. The advantage of using this technique compared to the classical statistical cokriging technique is that all the qualities are considered as variables with the same importance and that the sum of quality percentages in a block is one hundred percent. The validity of the method was tested in a crossvalidation process. The results compared favourably with those obtained using ordinary cokriging and fuzzy kriging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Facemasks and respirators have been stockpiled during pandemic preparedness. However, data on their effectiveness for limiting transmission are scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness of facemask use by index cases for limiting influenza transmission by large droplets produced during coughing in households. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A cluster randomized intervention trial was conducted in France during the 2008-2009 influenza season. Households were recruited during a medical visit of a household member with a positive rapid influenza A test and symptoms lasting less than 48 hours. Households were randomized either to the mask or control group for 7 days. In the intervention arm, the index case had to wear a surgical mask from the medical visit and for a period of 5 days. The trial was initially intended to include 372 households but was prematurely interrupted after the inclusion of 105 households (306 contacts) following the advice of an independent steering committee. We used generalized estimating equations to test the association between the intervention and the proportion of household contacts who developed an influenza-like illness during the 7 days following the inclusion. Influenza-like illness was reported in 24/148 (16.2{\%}) of the contacts in the intervention arm and in 25/158 (15.8{\%}) of the contacts in the control arm and the difference between arms was 0.40{\%} (95{\%}CI: -10{\%} to 11{\%}, P = 1.00). We observed a good adherence to the intervention. In various sensitivity analyses, we did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks. CONCLUSION This study should be interpreted with caution since the lack of statistical power prevents us to draw formal conclusion regarding effectiveness of facemasks in the context of a seasonal epidemic.

abstract = {Male employees from four local worksites were recruited to participate in a short-term and low-intensity nutrition intervention which focused on promoting low-fat dietary habits. The sites were randomized to control conditions or to the intervention programme that consisted of an individualized health risk appraisal, group sessions, mass media activities and environmental changes. Participants were seen before and three months after intervention to measure blood lipids, nutrition knowledge and dietary changes. Eighty-three per cent of all eligible subjects were screened (n = 770) and follow-up measures were obtained for 82{\%}. The score for nutrition knowledge improved significantly in the intervention group. There was also a net reduction in the intake of total calories and in the percentage of energy from total fat. Reported intake of carbohydrates and proteins increased. For all employees assessed, there were no changes in mean total cholesterol level or fatty acid composition. Only among participants with hypercholesterolemia was a significant reduction in blood cholesterol observed. This low-intensity intervention programme achieved some self-reported dietary changes and was successful (at least in part because statistical regression needs to be considered) in obtaining a more short-term beneficial cholesterol level in employees at higher cardiovascular risk.},

Serum concentrations of carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol, and ascorbic acid were examined at baseline, and one, two, and three-month points. Both serum beta-carotene and ascorbic acid were significantly higher in high-dose groups than in each placebo group during the supplementation. The serum beta-carotene increased gradually (597 - 830{\%} increase) during the study, whereas the serum ascorbic acid reached nearly a steady-state at the one-month point and remained stable thereafter (88 - 95{\%} increase). No statistically significant interaction between beta-carotene and vitamin C supplementations was observed either for serum beta-carotene or for serum ascorbic acid. Among carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol examined, serum lycopene in the high-dose beta-carotene group was significantly higher than in the placebo group at all points. No unfavorable change in carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol was observed in any group.},

The parallel-coupled model is thoroughly discussed, with scalability proven up to hundreds of cores. This work focuses on the mechanical part, including the constitutive model (proposing some modifications to pre-existent models), the numerical scheme and the coupling strategy. The model is next assessed through two examples. First, the simulation of a small piece of cardiac tissue is used to introduce the main features of the coupled model and calibrate its parameters against experimental evidence. Then, a more realistic prob- lem is solved using those parameters, with a mesh of the Oxford ventricular rabbit model. The results of both examples demonstrate the capability of the model to run efficiently in hundreds of processors and to reproduce some basic characteristic of cardiac deformation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Providing different programs of occupational health services in the same company is difficult. We report the results of a parallel randomized trial for the employees of our company for visceral fat measurements and the effect of a weight loss support web system. MATERIALS AND METHODS 181 healthy employees with BMI over 23 who volunteered to participate in this study. In a parallel randomized study, we divided them into 3 groups (A, health guidance by occupational health staff with visceral fat measurements and a weight loss support web system; B, health guidance by occupational health staff with a weight loss support web system; C, without health guidance (control)) by date of birth. To assess the effects of guidance and support, we compared each group's waist circumference (WC), weight, and BMI, before and after the guidance. We also conducted questionnaire surveys of eating behavior and life activities before and after the guidance to estimate the relationship between the intervention method used for each group and their behavioral modification. RESULTS 150 employees (83{\%}) finished this program. Within 3 months, reduction in the outcome measures was largest in group A, and showed significant differences from the other two groups. For many employees in group A, eating behavior factors improved markedly; however, in the control group, there were no changes in eating behavior or daily living activities. CONCLUSIONS A parallel randomized trial involving the employees of our company was performed and we scientifically verified the effects of an occupational health programs. Objective study of occupational health activities and measures were enabled by devising methods and procedures, e.g., applying the waiting-list method for the control group. This approach will lead to appropriate selection and precise implementation of evidence-based measures in occupational health in the future.},

METHODS In January 1984, a total of 26,311 residents in three municipalities of Miyagi Prefecture, in northern Japan (11,902 men and 14,409 women 40 years of age or older), completed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions about the frequency of consumption of green tea. During 199,748 person-years of follow-up, through December 1992, we identified 419 cases of gastric cancer (in 296 men and 123 women). We used Cox regression to estimate the relative risk of gastric cancer according to the consumption of green tea. RESULTS Green-tea consumption was not associated with the risk of gastric cancer. After adjustment for sex, age, presence or absence of a history of peptic ulcer smoking status, alcohol consumption, other dietary elements, and type of health insurance, the relative risks associated with drinking one or two, three or four, and five or more cups of green tea per day, as compared with less than one cup per day, were 1.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.6), 1.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.4), and 1.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.6), respectively (P for trend=0.13). The results were similar after the 117 cases of gastric cancer that were diagnosed in the first three years of follow-up had been excluded, with respective relative risks of 1.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.8) 1.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.5), and 1.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.9) (P for trend=0.07). CONCLUSIONS In a population-based, prospective cohort study in Japan, we found no association between green-tea consumption and the risk of gastric cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to provide a framework for the analysis of visceral obesity and its determinants in women, where complex inter-relationships are observed among lifestyle, nutritional and metabolic predictors. Thirty-four predictors related to lifestyle, adiposity, body fat distribution, blood lipids and adipocyte sizes have been considered as potential correlates of visceral obesity in women. To properly address the difficulties in managing such interactions given our limited sample of 150 women, bootstrapped Bayesian networks were constructed based on novel constraint-based learning methods that appeared recently in the statistical learning community. Statistical significance of edge strengths was evaluated and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network robustness. To allow accessible interpretation and integrate biological knowledge into the final network, several undirected edges were afterwards directed with physiological expertise according to relevant literature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Extensive experiments on synthetic data sampled from a known Bayesian network show that the algorithm, called Recursive Hybrid Parents and Children (RHPC), outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that appeared in the recent literature. Regarding biological plausibility, we found that the inference results obtained with the proposed method were in excellent agreement with biological knowledge. For example, these analyses indicated that visceral adipose tissue accumulation is strongly related to blood lipid alterations independent of overall obesity level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Bayesian Networks are a useful tool for investigating and summarizing evidence when complex relationships exist among predictors, in particular, as in the case of multifactorial conditions like visceral obesity, when there is a concurrent incidence for several variables, interacting in a complex manner.

abstract = {Theories of incentive motivation attempt to capture the way in which objects and events in the world can acquire high motivational value and drive behavior, even in the absence of a clear biological need. In addition, for an individual to select the most appropriate goal, the incentive values of competing desirable objects need to be defined and compared. The present study examined the neural substrates by which appetitive incentive value influences prospective goal selection, using positron emission tomographic neuroimaging in humans. Sated subjects were shown a series of restaurant menus that varied in incentive value, specifically tailored for each individual, and in half the trials, were asked to make a selection from the menu. The amygdala was activated by high-incentive menus regardless of whether a choice was required. Indeed, activity in this region varied as a function of individual subjective ratings of incentive value. In contrast, distinct regions of the orbitofrontal cortex were recruited both during incentive judgments and goal selection. Activity in the medial orbital cortex showed a greater response to high-incentive menus and when making a choice, with the latter activity also correlating with subjective ratings of difficulty. Lateral orbitofrontal activity was observed selectively when participants had to suppress responses to alternative desirable items to select their most preferred. Taken together, these data highlight the differential contribution of the amygdala and regions within the orbitofrontal cortex in a neural system underlying the selection of goals based on the prospective incentive value of stimuli, over and above homeostatic influences.},

From May 2001 to December 2002, we randomly enrolled 1514 men and 1528 women, stratified by age and gender, from the greater area of Athens. Blood samples were collected in the fasting state. Among other investigated factors, dietary habits (including coffee consumption in ml per day, adjusted for 28{\%} caffeine containment) were evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Men consumed higher quantities of coffee compared with women (250 +/- 55 vs 150 +/- 60 ml/day, P = 0.001), while homocysteine values were also higher in men than in women (14.5 +/- 6 vs 10.8 +/- 3.5 micromol/l, P = 0.001). A dose-response relationship of homocysteine levels with coffee consumption was observed (r = 0.10, P = 0.034). In particular, we found that homocysteine levels were 11.2 +/- 5 micromol/l for no consumption, 11.7 +/- 7 micromol/l for {\textless}100 ml/day, 12.5 +/- 7 micromol/l for 200-400 ml/day, and 12.7 +/- 4 micromol/l for {\textgreater}500 ml/day consumption (P = 0.018). The observed trend remained significant even after controlling for the interactions between coffee consumption with gender, smoking habits, physical activity status, and eating habits. However, the sole effect of the consumption of filtered coffee on homocysteine levels was significant only in those who consumed more than 500 ml/day (P = 0.043). Although our findings cannot be evidence for causality, they can be the basis for hypotheses about the relation between homocysteine and coffee that can partially explain the mechanisms by which elevated homocysteine levels may influence coronary risk.},

The primary outcome was the change in score on the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), used to evaluate the severity of age-/menopause-related complaints. Additional outcome measures included the subject-reported score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), which was used specifically to assess sleep quality. Results The symptoms assessed by the MRS improved during treatment in the active group. Comparison between placebo and treatment groups revealed statistically significant improvement in particular for dryness of vagina (−85.7{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.001), heart discomfort (−78.8{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001) and sexual problems (−73.3{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). On the HAM-D significant improvements at week 12 were seen in work and activities (−94.1{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.001). Subjects treated with equol and resveratrol also had significant differences in the sleep domain of the NHP (p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion These findings provide evidence that 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with equol and resveratrol may improve menopause-related quality of life in healthy women.},

abstract = {The adipocyte-derived hormones leptin [which circulates in a free form and bound to a soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R)], adiponectin, and resistin play a key role in regulating energy homeostasis and metabolism. We assessed the association between body composition, total energy, and macronutrient intake and serum leptin, sOB-R, free leptin index, adiponectin, and resistin concentrations in 61 female and 53 male consecutively enrolled healthy Greek students. In this cross-sectional study, total energy and macronutrient intake were determined using 3-d food records. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis; fasting blood samples were taken for the measurement of total leptin, sOB-R, adiponectin, and resistin; and the ratio leptin/sOB-R was used as an index of free leptin. Serum sOB-R concentrations were lower in the female subjects compared with the males (27.24 +/- 29.06 vs. 50.14 +/- 39.74 ng/ml, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas leptin, adiponectin, and resistin concentrations were significantly higher in females (leptin: 9.93 +/- 6.01 vs. 3.27 +/- 2.54 ng/ml, P {\textless} 0.001; adiponectin: 11.40 +/- 6.73 micro g/ml vs. 4.90 +/- 2.79 micro g/ml; P {\textless} 0.001; resistin: 16.86 +/- 5.39 ng/ml in females vs. 14.00 +/- 7.16 ng/ml in males, P {\textless} 0.02). Simple regression analysis showed that, in both genders, leptin, free leptin index, adiponectin, and resistin correlated positively with body fat mass and negatively with waist to hip ratio. sOB-R correlated negatively with body fat mass and positively with waist to hip ratio. Multiple regression analysis models controlling for gender, body fat, and total energy intake demonstrated that sOB-R is positively associated with energy intake from carbohydrates and negatively with energy intake from dietary fat, whereas free leptin index is negatively associated with energy intake from carbohydrates and positively with energy intake from dietary fat. No statistically significant correlations were observed between serum adiponectin or resistin concentrations and total energy or macronutrient intake. Thus, total energy intake and macronutrient composition of the diet are associated with sOB-R and free leptin index but do not play a role of comparable significance in predicting adiponectin and resistin concentrations in healthy young subjects.},

abstract = {Results Approximately 32{\%} fewer neonates who received the moisturizer had AD/eczema by week 32 than control subjects (P =.012, log-rank test). We did not show a statistically significant effect of emollient on allergic sensitization based on the level of IgE antibody against egg white at 0.34 kU A /L CAP-FEIA equivalents. However, the sensitization rate was significantly higher in infants who had AD/eczema than in those who did not (odds ratio, 2.86; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-6.73). Conclusion Daily application of moisturizer during the first 32 weeks of life reduces the risk of AD/eczema in infants. Allergic sensitization during this time period is associated with the presence of eczematous skin but not with moisturizer use.
Background Recent studies have suggested that epidermal barrier dysfunction contributes to the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) and other allergic diseases. Objective We performed a prospective, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether protecting the skin barrier with a moisturizer during the neonatal period prevents development of AD and allergic sensitization.
Methods An emulsion-type moisturizer was applied daily during the first 32 weeks of life to 59 of 118 neonates at high risk for AD (based on having a parent or sibling with AD) who were enrolled in this study. The onset of AD (eczematous symptoms lasting {\textgreater}4 weeks) and eczema (lasting {\textgreater}2 weeks) was assessed by a dermatology specialist on the basis of the modified Hanifin and Rajka criteria. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of AD plus eczema (AD/eczema) at week 32 of life. A secondary outcome, allergic sensitization, was evaluated based on serum levels of allergen-specific IgE determined by using a high-sensitivity allergen microarray of diamond-like carbon-coated chips.},

abstract = {Environmental interventions such as labeling and an increased availability of healthy foods may help consumers to meet guidelines for a healthy diet. This article describes a study into the effectiveness of two environmental programs to be used in worksite cafeterias along with an educational program. The aim of the interventions was to reduce fat intake, and to increase fruit and vegetable intake. In the labeling program, low-fat products were labeled. The food supply program comprised an increased availability of low-fat products and fruits and vegetables in worksite cafeterias. The educational program consisted of information about healthy nutrition through brochures, table tents, a self-help manual and posters. The design consisted of a pre-test-post-test experimental control group design, with four conditions: the educational program; the food supply program plus educational program; the labeling program plus educational program; and a control group. Seventeen worksites were randomly assigned to one of the four research conditions. Total fat, fruit and vegetable intake was measured with a quantitative, self-administered food frequency questionnaire (35 questions). Intake during lunch was measured by asking respondents to write down which food items they had purchased during their last lunch in the cafeteria. Furthermore, sales data for some targeted product categories were collected (milk, butter, cheese, meat products, desserts). For the whole study population, no significant effects on consumption data were found for any of the programs. The data showed a beneficial and significant treatment effect of the labeling program on total fat intake for respondents who believed they ate a high-fat diet. Sales data revealed a significant effect of the labeling program on desserts, but not for the other products.},

abstract = {Study Design.A clinical study on osteoporotic vertebral strength in daily living using a computed tomography (CT)-based nonlinear finite element (FE) model.
Objective.To evaluate the differences in predicted fracture strength of osteoporotic vertebral bodies among the different loading conditions that are occurring in the activities of daily living.
Summary of Background Data.FE model has been reported to predict vertebral strength in uniaxial loading, but forward bending load plays an important role in osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
Methods.Strengths of the second lumbar vertebra in 41 female patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis were analyzed using a nonlinear CT-based FE method. Three different loading conditions were adopted uniaxial compression, forward bending, and erect standing. The same boundary condition was used for all loading conditions. Predicted strengths under forward bending and erect standing were compared with that under uniaxial compression and differences in strength were statistically analyzed.
Results.The regression equation relating strength under uniaxial compression to that under erect standing was expressed as y = 0.8912x + 19.332 (R = 0.9522), whereas the equation relating uniaxial compression to forward bending was y = 0.7033x + 55.071 (R = 0.8342). Both relationships were significant, but the correlation between forward bending and uniaxial compression was not strong, while strength was lower under forward bending than under uniaxial compression according to the Friedman multiple comparison test (P = 0.00017).
Conclusion.Strength under forward bending correlated significantly to that under uniaxial compression, but the correlation was not strong. Therefore, in osteoporotic patients, both uniaxial compression and forward bending should be assessed to evaluate fracture risk in daily living using a CT-based FE method.},

It has thus been apparent, since the early days of EIT research, that imaging of ventilation could become a key clinical application of EIT. In this paper, we review the current state and future prospects for lung EIT, by a synthesis of the presentations of the authors at the 'special lung sessions' of the annual biomedical EIT conferences in 2009–2011. We argue that lung EIT research has arrived at an important transition. It is now clear that valid and reproducible physiological information is available from EIT lung images. We must now ask the question: How can these data be used to help improve patient outcomes? To answer this question, we develop a classification of possible clinical scenarios in which EIT could play an important role, and we identify clinical and experimental research programmes and engineering developments required to turn EIT into a clinically useful tool for lung monitoring.},

Highly significant positive correlations (p {\textless} 0.001) were found between the wet density of bone and the dry and ash densities. The specific capacitance of the cancellous bone specimens in all three orthogonal directions showed significant (p {\textless} 0.01) positive correlations with the wet, dry, and ash densities.

The purpose was to assess the clinical use of lung density estimation using EIT data. In 11 patients supported by a mechanical ventilator, the consistency of regional lung density measurements as estimated by EIT was validated to assess the feasibility of its use in intensive care medicine. There were significant differences in regional lung densities recorded in the supine position between normal lungs and diseased lungs associated with pneumonia, atelectasis and pleural effusion (normal; 240 ± 71.7 kg m(-3), pneumonia; 306 ± 38.6 kg m(-3), atelectasis; 497 ± 130 kg m(-3), pleural effusion; 467 ± 113 kg m(-3): Steel-Dwass test, p {\textless} 0.05). In addition, in order to compare lung density with CT image pixels, the image resolution of CT images, which was originally 512 × 512 pixels, was changed to 16 × 16 pixels to match that of the EIT images. The results of CT and EIT images from five patients in an intensive care unit showed a correlation coefficient of 0.66 ± 0.13 between the CT values (HU) and the lung density values (kg m(-3)) obtained from EIT. These results indicate that it may be possible to obtain a quantitative value for regional lung density using EIT.},

abstract = {Objective A cluster of multiple risk factors has been noted to constitute the background of cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the visceral fat area (VFA) or subcutaneous fat area (SFA) and a cluster of obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors, including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and elevated blood pressure, in middle-aged Japanese men and women. Methods A total of 571 subjects (m=434; f=137; age: 53±9 years) who underwent health examinations with evaluations of body fat distribution using computed tomography scans and assessments of 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests were enrolled in this study. Results The VFA and SFA were linearly correlated with the number of risk factors in both men and women. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of VFA (m=0.741, f=0.763) was significantly higher than that of SFA (m=0.636, f=0.689) with respect to the clustering of risk factors (one or more). The men exhibited larger VFA values and smaller SFA values than the women in similar body mass index (BMI) categories. Men with a VFA of ≥100 cm2 irrespective of BMI and women with a VFA of ≥100 cm2 and a BMI of ≥25 kg/m2 demonstrated a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance. Men and women with a VFA of ≥100 cm2 irrespective of BMI demonstrated a high prevalence of type IIb dyslipidemia. Conclusion These results suggest that the absolute value of VFA rather than SFA is more closely associated with a cluster of risk factors irrespective of sex and is a good marker for selecting subjects to whom weight reduction should be recommended in order to prevent cardiovascular disease in the general population. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.},

abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for a plethora of severe morbidities and premature death. Most supporting evidence comes from observational studies that are prone to chance, bias and confounding. Even data on the protective effects of weight loss from randomized controlled trials will be susceptible to confounding and bias if treatment assignment cannot be masked, which is usually the case with lifestyle and surgical interventions. Thus, whilst obesity is widely considered the major modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases, its causes and consequences are often difficult to determine. Addressing this is important, as the prevention and treatment of any disease requires that interventions focus on causal risk factors. Disease prediction, although not dependent on knowing the causes, is nevertheless enhanced by such knowledge. Here, we provide an overview of some of the barriers to causal inference in obesity research and discuss analytical approaches, such as Mendelian randomization, that can help to overcome these obstacles. In a systematic review of the literature in this field, we found: (i) probable causal relationships between adiposity and bone health/disease, cancers (colorectal, lung and kidney cancers), cardiometabolic traits (blood pressure, fasting insulin, inflammatory markers and lipids), uric acid concentrations, coronary heart disease and venous thrombosis (in the presence of pulmonary embolism), (ii) possible causal relationships between adiposity and gray matter volume, depression and common mental disorders, oesophageal cancer, macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease, diabetic kidney disease, nuclear cataract and gall stone disease, and (iii) no evidence for causal relationships between adiposity and Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer, venous thrombosis (in the absence of pulmonary embolism), liver function and periodontitis.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In the experiment, participants were classified into two groups: one consisting of freshmen that habitually ate a Japanese-style breakfast during childhood (n=28) and the other of freshmen that habitually ate a Western-style breakfast (n=20). They were asked to complete a personalized implicit association test (IAT) and a self-report questionnaire, both of which measure attitudes toward Japanese and Western foods. Results demonstrated that implicit and explicit associations between Japanese food and attitude in the Japanese-style breakfast group were stronger than those between type of food and attitude in the Western-style breakfast group. Thus, positive attitudes toward traditional diets in young Japanese are likely related to the type of breakfast eaten in childhood. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {AIM: Although previous studies have shown that consumption of green tea catechins (GTC) and walking might prevent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the effects of GTC supplementation on CVD risk in active older people are unknown. METHODS: A total of 52 older adults (male/female 20/32, mean age 69.1 ± 5.9 years) participating in a pedometer-based walking program were randomly assigned to a GTC group with an intake of 630.9 mg GTC daily (n=26) or a control group (n=26) for 14 weeks. Cardiovascular risk markers were measured before and after this trial. RESULTS: In the GTC group, values of the following markers were significantly reduced (P{\textless}0.05) from the beginning to the end of the trial: waist circumference (from 84.2 ± 8.4 to 82.2 ± 8.5 cm), hip circumference (from 95.1 ± 6.9 to 92.2 ± 6.3 cm), total cholesterol (from 233.0 ± 46.3 to 218.8 ± 42.3 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 130.4 ± 36.2 to 119.1 ± 33.4 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (from 2.0 ± 1.7 to 1.7 ± 0.5); only hip circumference (from 95.6 ± 8.1 to 94.1 ± 7.6 cm) was significantly reduced (P{\textless}0.05) in the control group. No significant between-group differences were found for any parameter measured. CONCLUSIONS: Although GTC might reduce cholesterol levels, the present randomized control trial suggests that GTC supplementation in active older participants did not significantly affect cardiovascular risk markers. Future studies should identify more effective combinations of GTC supplementation and physical activity.},

Each patient consumed the 14-day controlled test diet containing either 10 g day(-1) of DAG or TAG oil for acclimatization before a respiratory chamber measurement, followed by a 2-week washout period between diet treatments. Substrate oxidation and EE were measured in the respiratory chamber at the end of each dietary treatment. The patients consumed test oil as 15{\%} of total caloric intake in the respiratory chamber (mean test oil intake was 36.1+/-6.6 g day(-1)).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Twenty-four hour fat oxidation was significantly greater with 14 days of DAG oil consumption compared with TAG oil consumption (78.6+/-19.6 and 72.6+/-14.9 g day(-1), respectively, P{\textless}0.05). There were no differences in body weight or body composition between diet treatments. Dietary fat oxidation was determined using the recovery rate of (13)CO(2) in breath, and was significantly enhanced with DAG oil consumption compared with TAG oil consumption, measured over 22 h after ingestion of (13)C-labelled triolein. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was significantly greater with DAG oil consumption compared with TAG oil consumption (1766+/-337 and 1680+/-316 kcal day(-1), respectively, P{\textless}0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Consumption of DAG oil for 14 days stimulates both fat oxidation and RMR compared with TAG oil consumption, which may explain the greater loss of body weight and body fat with DAG oil consumption that has been observed in weight-loss studies.},

Cinnamate derivatives which would not release cinnamic acid by hydrolysis are excluded. The quantitative data are reviewed concisely and attention is drawn to certain shortcomings, in particular a complete absence of data for certain commodities (breakfast cereals, baked goods, tomato products and nuts) and minimal data for pulses, legumes and processed or cooked foods. In addition, more data are required for the edible portion of modern varieties. By extrapolating from such data as are available the important source(s) (i) of individual cinnamates (regardless of the conjugate type) and (ii) of each major class of conjugate, have been identified as follows: (i) Cinnamates: caffeic acid: coffee beverage, blueberries, apples, ciders; p-coumaric acid: spinach, sugar beet fibre, cereal brans; ferulic acid: coffee beverage, citrus juices, sugar beet fibre, cereal brans; sinapic acid: broccoli, kale, other leafy brassicas, citrus juices. (ii) Conjugates: caffeoylquinic acids: coffee beverage, blueberries, apples, ciders; p-coumaroylquinic acids: sweet cherries; feruloylquinic acids: coffee beverage; tartaric conjugates: spinach, lettuce, grapes and wines; malic conjugates: lettuce, spinach, possibly legumes; rosmarinic acid: culinary herbs, mixed herbs, possibly stuffings; cell wall conjugates: spinach, sugar beet fibre, cereal brans. It seems likely that the UK population will fall into several categories depending on (i) their consumption of coffee, (ii) their consumption of bran, and (iii) their consumption of citrus. Those who drink several cups of coffee per day augmented by bran and citrus might easily ingest 500–800 mg cinnamates (or even 1 g for the greatest coffee ingest consumption) whereas those who eschew all these and take little fresh fruit or vegetables might struggle to consume 25 mg.},

RH-PAT is an index of endothelial function, indicating initial atherosclerotic lesions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of lifestyle modification with a focus on exercise training on RH-PAT in obese patients. We studied 43 obese patients (body mass index ≥ 30). RH-PAT was measured, and the RH-PAT index was calculated as a ratio of the digital pulse volume during reactive hyperemia divided by that at baseline. Further, we assessed body composition, arterial stiffness, insulin resistance, adipocytokine levels, and exercise tolerance. The exercise program consisted of 30 min on a cycle ergometer or treadmill, 3 times per week for 6 months. Training intensity was adjusted to the anaerobic threshold. Significant improvements were observed in the RH-PAT index following exercise training. We noted a significant reduction in weight, body fat percentage, and leptin values, and a significant increase in adiponectin levels and exercise tolerance. An abnormal baseline RH-PAT index was observed in 24 patients (55.8{\%}); however, the improvement rate was higher in these patients than in patients with normal RH-PAT index values. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that changes in insulin resistance ($\Delta$HOMA-IR) were independently correlated with changes in the RH-PAT index. Our results indicate that lifestyle modification with a focus on exercise training improved the RH-PAT index in obese patients. Patients with abnormal RH-PAT index values before lifestyle modification with exercise training demonstrated a high rate of improvement following exercise. Further, our results suggest that insulin resistance was the only independent factor influencing improvement in endothelial function.},

The energy intake from between-meal snacks correlated with SFA (standardized regression coefficient $\beta$ = 0.174, p = 0.002). The coefficient of alcohol intake was positive for VFA and negative for SFA, and alcohol intake correlated with the VFA/total fat area (TFA) ratio ($\beta$ = 0.130, p = 0.009). Alcohol intake was positively correlated with the blood non-esterified fatty acid concentration. Alcohol consumption additively increased energy intake from supper. The risk of an increase to VFA ≥ 100 cm(2) was 2.02 times higher (95{\%} CI: 1.15, 3.56) for subjects whose energy intake was ≥ 2200 kcal/d, and 2.07 times higher (95{\%} CI: 1.26, 3.42) in those who consumed ≥ 3 g/d alcohol. The risk of an increase to a VFA/TFA ratio ≥ 0.4 was 1.81 times higher (95{\%} CI: 1.01, 3.23) for subjects whose energy intake from supper was ≥ 1000 kcal/d.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that habitual alcohol drinking and high-energy intake from supper are associated with disproportionate accumulation of visceral fat.},

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the pathological accumulation of fat in the liver in the absence of any other disease related to liver steatosis, which includes a wide spectrum of liver diseases ranging from mild asymptomatic fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Recently, it was reported that NAFLD is characterized by the impaired bioavailability of liver n-6 and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). That is, compared with healthy individuals, steatosis and steatohepatitis patients have higher n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios. Furthermore, per recent research, decreasing the intake of total fats and increasing the intake of n-3 PUFAs may be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD. In contrast, some reports describe that NASH patients have more metabolic abnormalities than NAFLD patients; however, these are not influenced by dietary fatty acids. Thus, at present, various opinions exist regarding the efficacy of n-3 PUFA in the treatment of NAFLD. In this review, we discuss the considerable interest n-3 PUFA has attracted as a potential treatment for NAFLD.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies indicate that habitual coffee consumption lowers the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Postprandial hyperglycemia is a direct and independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We previously demonstrated that coffee polyphenol ingestion increased secretion of Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which has been shown to exhibit anti-diabetic and cardiovascular effects. We hypothesized coffee polyphenol consumption may improve postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular endothelial function by increasing GLP-1 release and/or reducing oxidative stress. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized, acute, crossover, intervention study in healthy male adults, measuring blood parameters and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) after ingestion of a meal with or without coffee polyphenol extract (CPE). Nineteen subjects consumed a test meal with either a placebo- or CPE-containing beverage. Blood biomarkers and FMD were measured at fasting and up to 180 minutes postprandially. The CPE beverage led to a significantly lower peak postprandial increase in blood glucose and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolite, and significantly higher postprandial FMD than the placebo beverage. Postprandial blood GLP-1 increase tended to be higher after ingestion of the CPE beverage, compared with placebo. Subclass analysis revealed that the CPE beverage significantly improved postprandial blood GLP-1 response and reduced blood glucose increase in the subjects with a lower insulinogenic index. Correlation analysis showed postprandial FMD was negatively associated with blood glucose increase after ingestion of the CPE beverage. In conclusion, these results suggest that coffee polyphenol consumption improves postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular endothelial function, which is associated with increased GLP-1 secretion and decreased oxidative stress in healthy humans.},

abstract = {Food intake is an essential human activity regulated by homeostatic and hedonic systems in the brain which has mostly been ignored by the cognitive neurosciences. Yet, the study of food intake integrates fundamental cognitive and emotional processes in the human brain, and can in particular provide evidence on the neural correlates of the hedonic experience central to guiding behaviour. Neuroimaging experiments provide a novel basis for the further exploration of the brain systems involved in the conscious experience of pleasure and reward, and thus provide a unique method for studying the hedonic quality of human experience. Recent neuroimaging experiments have identified some of the regions involved in the cortical networks mediating hedonic experience in the human brain, with the evidence suggesting that the orbitofrontal cortex is the perhaps strongest candidate for linking food and other kinds of reward to hedonic experience. Based on the reviewed literature, a model is proposed to account for the roles of the different parts of the orbitofrontal cortex in this hedonic network. {\textcopyright} 2004 IBRO.

Information about the association between diet and adipose tissue is scarce. This study aimed to identify food group intake associated with VAT and SAAT and the VAT:SAAT ratio in a Northern German population. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 344 men and 241 women who underwent an MRI to quantify total volumes of VAT and SAAT. Intake of fourteen food groups was assessed with a self-administered 112-item FFQ. Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, energy intake, physical activity, intake of other food groups and mutual adjustment for VAT and SAAT were calculated to analyse the associations between standardised food group intake and VAT and SAAT, or the VAT:SAAT ratio.

abstract = {Nutrition is an important "modifiable" factor in the development and maintenance of bone mass and in the prevention of osteoporosis. The improvement of calcium intake in prepuberal age translates to gain in bone mass and, with genetic factor, to achievement of Peak Bone Mass (PBM), the higher level of bone mass reached at the completion of physiological growth. Individuals with higher PBM achieved in early adulthood will be at lower risk for developing osteoporosis later in life. Achieved the PBM, it is important maintain the bone mass gained and reduce the loss. This is possible adopting a correct behaviour eating associated to regular physical activity and correct life style. The diet is nutritionally balanced with caloric intake adequate to requirement of individual. This is moderate in protein (1 g/kg/die), normal in fat and the carbohydrates provide 55-60{\%} of the caloric intake. A moderate intake of proteins is associated with normal calcium metabolism and presumably does'nt alter bone turnover. An adequate intake of alkali-rich foods may help promote a favorable effect of dietary protein on the skeleton. Lactose intolerance may determinate calcium malabsorption or may decrease calcium intake by elimination of milk and dairy products. Omega3 fatty acids may "down-regulate" pro-inflammatory cytokines and protect against bone loss by decreasing osteoclast activation and bone reabsorption. The diet is characterized by food containing high amount of calcium, potassium, magnesium and low amount of sodium. If it is impossible to reach the requirement with only diet, it is need the supplement of calcium and vitamin D. Other vitamins (Vit. A, C, E, K) and mineral (phosphorus, fluoride, iron, zinc, copper and boron) are required for normal bone metabolism, thus it is need adequate intake of these dietary components. It is advisable reduce ethanol, caffeine, fibers, phytic and ossalic acid intake. The efficacy of phytoestrogens is actually under investigation. Some drugs may interfere with calcium and other nutrients and produce an unfavourable effect on bone health.},

abstract = {A maximum likelihood procedure is given for estimating household and community transmission parameters from observed influenza infection data. The estimator for the household transmission probability is an improvement over the classical secondary attack rate calculations because it factors out community-acquired infections from true secondary infections. The mathematical model used does not require the specification of infection onset times and, therefore, can be used with serologic data which detect asymptomatic infections. Infection data were derived by serology and virus isolation from the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study and the Seattle Flu Study for the years 1975-1979. Included were seasons of influenza B and influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. The transmission characteristics of influenza B and influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) outbreaks during this period are compared. Influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B are found to be in descending order both in terms of ease of spread in the household and intensity of the epidemic in the community. Children are found to be the main introducers of influenza into households. the degree of estimation error from the misclassification of infected and susceptible individuals is illustrated with a stochastic simulation model. This model simulates the expected number of detected infections at different levels of sensitivity and specificity for the serologic tests used. Other sources of estimation error, such as deviation from the model assumption of uniform community exposure and the possible presence of superspreaders, are also discussed.},

We then use them in the inverse problem with known internal boundaries and derive the associated Jacobians. We report on the results of two EIT phantom studies, one using a homogeneous cubical tank, and one using a cylindrical tank with agar conductivity inhomogeneities. We test both the accuracy of our BEM forward model, including the electrode models, as well as our inverse solution, against the measured data. Results show good agreement between measured values and both forward-computed tank voltages and inverse-computed conductivities; for instance, in a phantom experiment, we reconstructed the conductivities of three agar objects inside a cylindrical tank with an error less than 2{\%} of their true value.},

abstract = {Count data with excess zeros relative to a Poisson distribution are common in many biomedical applications. A popular approach to the analysis of such data is to use a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model. Often, because of the hierarchical study design or the data collection procedure, zero-inflation and lack of independence may occur simultaneously, which render the standard ZIP model inadequate. To account for the preponderance of zero counts and the inherent correlation of observations, a class of multi-level ZIP regression model with random effects is presented. Model fitting is facilitated using an expectation-maximization algorithm, whereas variance components are estimated via residual maximum likelihood estimating equations. A score test for zero-inflation is also presented. The multi-level ZIP model is then generalized to cope with a more complex correlation structure. Application to the analysis of correlated count data from a longitudinal infant feeding study illustrates the usefulness of the approach.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Medications that influence the risk of dementia in the elderly can be relevant for dementia prevention. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases but have also been shown to be potentially involved in cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between the use of PPIs and the risk of incident dementia in the elderly. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a prospective cohort study using observational data from 2004 to 2011, derived from the largest German statutory health insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen (AOK). Data on inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision) and drug prescriptions (categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) were available on a quarterly basis. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2015. EXPOSURES Prescription of omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, or rabeprazole. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was a diagnosis of incident dementia coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. The association between PPI use and dementia was analyzed using time-dependent Cox regression. The model was adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. RESULTS A total of 73 679 participants 75 years of age or older and free of dementia at baseline were analyzed. The patients receiving regular PPI medication (n = 2950; mean [SD] age, 83.8 [5.4] years; 77.9{\%} female) had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving PPI medication (n = 70 729; mean [SD] age, 83.0 [5.6] years; 73.6{\%} female) (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95{\%} CI, 1.36-1.52]; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The avoidance of PPI medication may prevent the development of dementia. This finding is supported by recent pharmacoepidemiological analyses on primary data and is in line with mouse models in which the use of PPIs increased the levels of $\beta$-amyloid in the brains of mice. Randomized, prospective clinical trials are needed to examine this connection in more detail.},

Mendelian randomization analysis showed significant positive associations between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD higher BMI, 1.64; 95{\%} CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 × 10−19), coronary heart disease (OR, 1.35; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .007) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.53; 95{\%} CI, 2.04-3.13; P = 1.5 × 10−17), as well as systolic blood pressure ($\beta$ = 1.65 mm Hg; 95{\%} CI, 0.78-2.52 mm Hg; P = 2.0 × 10−04) and diastolic blood pressure ($\beta$ = 1.37 mm Hg; 95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.85 mm Hg; P = 3.6 × 10−08). These associations were independent of age, sex, Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history.Conclusions and Relevance The results of this study add to the burgeoning evidence of an association between higher BMI and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This finding has relevance for public health policies in many countries with increasing obesity levels.},

abstract = {Preparations of green tea are used as aids in weight loss and weight maintenance. Catechins and caffeine, both contained in green tea, are each believed to have a role in increasing energy metabolism, which may lead to weight loss. A number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the role of green tea in weight loss have been published; however, the efficacy of green tea preparations in weight loss remains unclear. To assess the efficacy and safety of green tea preparations for weight loss and weight maintenance in overweight or obese adults. We searched the following databases from inception to specified date as well as reference lists of relevant articles: The Cochrane Library (Issue 12, 2011), MEDLINE (December 2011), EMBASE (December 2011), CINAHL (January 2012), AMED (January 2012), Biological Abstracts (January 2012), IBIDS (August 2010), Obesity+ (January 2012), IPA (January 2012) and Web of Science (December 2011). Current Controlled Trials with links to other databases of ongoing trials was also searched. RCTs of at least 12 weeks' duration comparing green tea preparations to a control in overweight or obese adults. Three authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias and quality, with differences resolved by consensus. Heterogeneity of included studies was assessed visually using forest plots and quantified using the I(2) statistic. We synthesised data using meta-analysis and descriptive analysis as appropriate; subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Adverse effects reported in studies were recorded. Due to the level of heterogeneity among studies, studies were divided into two groups; those conducted in Japan and those conducted outside Japan. Study length ranged between 12 and 13 weeks. Meta-analysis of six studies conducted outside Japan showed a mean difference (MD) in weight loss of -0.04 kg (95{\%} CI -0.5 to 0.4; P = 0.88; I(2) = 18{\%}; 532 participants). The eight studies conducted in Japan were not similar enough to allow pooling of results and MD in weight loss ranged from -0.2 kg to -3.5 kg (1030 participants) in favour of green tea preparations. Meta-analysis of studies measuring change in body mass index (BMI) conducted outside Japan showed a MD in BMI of -0.2 kg/m(2) (95{\%} CI -0.5 to 0.1; P = 0.21; I(2) = 38{\%}; 222 participants). Differences among the eight studies conducted in Japan did not allow pooling of results and showed a reduction in BMI ranging from no effect to -1.3 kg/m(2) (1030 participants), in favour of green tea preparations over control. Meta-analysis of five studies conducted outside Japan and measuring waist circumference reported a MD of -0.2 cm (95{\%} CI -1.4 to 0.9; P = 0.70; I(2) = 58{\%}; 404 participants). Differences among the eight studies conducted in Japan did not allow pooling of results and showed effects on waist circumference ranging from a gain of 1 cm to a loss of 3.3 cm (1030 participants). Meta-analysis for three weight loss studies, conducted outside Japan, with waist-to-hip ratio data (144 participants) yielded no significant change (MD 0; 95{\%} CI -0.02 to 0.01). Analysis of two studies conducted to determine if green tea could help to maintain weight after a period of weight loss (184 participants) showed a change in weight loss of 0.6 to -1.6 kg, a change in BMI from 0.2 to -0.5 kg/m(2) and a change in waist circumference from 0.3 to -1.7 cm. In the eight studies that recorded adverse events, four reported adverse events that were mild to moderate, with the exception of two (green tea preparations group) that required hospitalisation (reported as not associated with the intervention). Nine studies reported on compliance/adherence, one study assessed attitude towards eating as part of the health-related quality of life outcome. No studies reported on patient satisfaction, morbidity or cost. Green tea preparations appear to induce a small, statistically non-significant weight loss in overweight or obese adults. Because the amount of weight loss is small, it is not likely to be clinically important. Green tea had no significant effect on the maintenance of weight loss. Of those studies recording information on adverse events, only two identified an adverse event requiring hospitalisation. The remaining adverse events were judged to be mild to moderate.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Reduced energy expenditure following weight loss is thought to contribute to weight gain. However, the effect of dietary composition on energy expenditure during weight-loss maintenance has not been studied. OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of 3 diets differing widely in macronutrient composition and glycemic load on energy expenditure following weight loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A controlled 3-way crossover design involving 21 overweight and obese young adults conducted at Children's Hospital Boston and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, between June 16, 2006, and June 21, 2010, with recruitment by newspaper advertisements and postings. INTERVENTION After achieving 10{\%} to 15{\%} weight loss while consuming a run-in diet, participants consumed an isocaloric low-fat diet (60{\%} of energy from carbohydrate, 20{\%} from fat, 20{\%} from protein; high glycemic load), low-glycemic index diet (40{\%} from carbohydrate, 40{\%} from fat, and 20{\%} from protein; moderate glycemic load), and very low-carbohydrate diet (10{\%} from carbohydrate, 60{\%} from fat, and 30{\%} from protein; low glycemic load) in random order, each for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was resting energy expenditure (REE), with secondary outcomes of total energy expenditure (TEE), hormone levels, and metabolic syndrome components. RESULTS Compared with the pre-weight-loss baseline, the decrease in REE was greatest with the low-fat diet (mean [95{\%} CI], -205 [-265 to -144] kcal/d), intermediate with the low-glycemic index diet (-166 [-227 to -106] kcal/d), and least with the very low-carbohydrate diet (-138 [-198 to -77] kcal/d; overall P = .03; P for trend by glycemic load = .009). The decrease in TEE showed a similar pattern (mean [95{\%} CI], -423 [-606 to -239] kcal/d; -297 [-479 to -115] kcal/d; and -97 [-281 to 86] kcal/d, respectively; overall P = .003; P for trend by glycemic load {\textless} .001). Hormone levels and metabolic syndrome components also varied during weight maintenance by diet (leptin, P {\textless} .001; 24-hour urinary cortisol, P = .005; indexes of peripheral [P = .02] and hepatic [P = .03] insulin sensitivity; high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, P {\textless} .001; non-HDL cholesterol, P {\textless} .001; triglycerides, P {\textless} .001; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, P for trend = .04; and C-reactive protein, P for trend = .05), but no consistent favorable pattern emerged. CONCLUSION Among overweight and obese young adults compared with pre-weight-loss energy expenditure, isocaloric feeding following 10{\%} to 15{\%} weight loss resulted in decreases in REE and TEE that were greatest with the low-fat diet, intermediate with the low-glycemic index diet, and least with the very low-carbohydrate diet.

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) calculates the internal conductivity distribution within a body using electrical contact measurements. The image reconstruction for EIT is an inverse problem, which is both non-linear and ill-posed. The traditional regularization method cannot avoid introducing negative values in the solution. The negativity of the solution produces artifacts in reconstructed images in presence of noise. A statistical method, namely, the expectation maximization (EM) method, is used to solve the inverse problem for EIT in this paper. The mathematical model of EIT is transformed to the non-negatively constrained likelihood minimization problem. The solution is obtained by the gradient projection-reduced Newton (GPRN) iteration method. This paper also discusses the strategies of choosing parameters. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the reconstructed images with higher quality can be obtained by the EM method, compared with the traditional Tikhonov and conjugate gradient (CG) methods, even with non-negative processing. {\textcopyright} 2012 ISA.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown that a deterioration of skin properties, an impaired cutaneous microcirculatory function and an imbalance of autonomic nervous activity are observed in smokers and in patients with diabetes mellitus or Raynaud's phenomenon. These observations suggest that skin properties are associated with cutaneous microcirculatory function and autonomic nervous activity in pathological conditions. However, there is no published evidence to support the concept that these two functions have any relationship with skin properties even in healthy subjects. To investigate the hypothesis that these properties are related, we conducted a survey of healthy adult subjects to investigate the relationships between cutaneous microcirculatory function and autonomic nervous activity and skin properties. METHODS: The hydration of the stratum corneum and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were investigated as skin properties, and the responsiveness of skin blood flow (SkBF) to local warming was examined as an index of cutaneous microcirculatory function in 19 healthy adult male subjects. Electrocardiograms were monitored for 24 h and heart rate variability was analysed considering low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.40 Hz) and a ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF) as indices of autonomic nervous activity; HF is an index of parasympathetic activity, whereas LF/HF is an index of sympathovagal balance. The relationships between those indices were then analysed. RESULTS: A moderate negative correlation was found between TEWL and the relative maximum rate of increases in the responsiveness of SkBF on local warming. A moderate positive and a moderate negative correlation were observed between TEWL and LF/HF or HF, respectively. Moreover, a moderate negative and a moderate positive correlation were shown between the responsiveness of SkBF and LF/HF or HF, respectively. The hydration of the stratum corneum showed no correlations with any indices of microcirculation or autonomic nervous activity. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that skin barrier function, cutaneous microcirculatory function and autonomic nervous activity are mutually associated in healthy adults.},

It explains the three main stages of this transition, namely the adoption of Western haute cuisine by the Japanese elite, the diffusion of Western ingredients, dishes and cookery techniques among the urban middle class, and the popularization of the new Japanese-Western hybrid cuisine by the military. This new cuisine began to acquire the status of culinary 'tradition' from the 1950s onwards. Dietary changes in modern Japan were to a large extent a consequence of deliberate policies of the government. In the early stage, Westernization of the elite's diet was regarded as necessary in order to achieve a status of a 'civilized' nation. Later, deliberate dietary reforms were undertaken with the aim of improving physical conditions of the population. These deliberate actions were directly influenced by the political circumstances in which Japan found itself in the period discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Dietary patterns in Western populations have been linked to type 2 diabetes, but the association of distinctive dietary patterns of Japanese population remains unclear. We prospectively investigated the association between dietary patterns and risk of developing type 2 diabetes among Japanese adults. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants were 27, 816 men and 36,889 women aged 45-74 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study and had no history of diabetes. Dietary patterns were derived by using principal component analysis of the consumption of 134 food and beverage items ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios of self-reported physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over 5 year were estimated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1194 new cases (692 men and 502 women) of type 2 diabetes were self-reported. We identified three dietary patterns: prudent, westernized and traditional Japanese patterns. Any dietary pattern was not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk after adjustment for covariates in both men and women. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95{\%} confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes for the highest versus lowest quartile of each dietary pattern score in men and women, respectively, were 0.93 (0.74-1.16) and 0.90 (0.69-1.16) for the prudent pattern, 1.15 (0.90-1.46) and 0.81 (0.61-1.08) for the westernized pattern, and 0.97 (0.74-1.27) and 0.87 (0.66-1.15) for the traditional pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Although a small protective effect of the prudent dietary pattern cannot be excluded, dietary patterns may not be appreciably associated with type 2 diabetes risk in Japanese.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship between circulating adiponectin, leptin and vaspin with bone mineral density (BMD), arterial stiffness and vascular calcification in post-menopausal women. We hypothesised that adipokines produced by adipose tissue may be mediators of bone and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and explain, in part, the observed association between osteoporosis and CVD. DESIGN We studied 386 ambulant community dwelling postmenopausal women aged (mean [SD] 61 [6.4] years). BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH), body composition; fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM) as well as abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) were determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index, markers of arterial stiffness were measured. Fasting adiponectin, leptin and vaspin were quantified in serum. RESULTS A positive independent association was observed between vaspin and BMD at the FN (p = 0.009), TH (p = 0.037) in the whole study population adjusted for confounders including age, FM, LM and lifestyle variables. Using the same model, a negative association was seen between adiponectin and BMD at the FN in women with osteoporosis (p = 0.043). Serum adiponectin was significantly higher in women with fractures (20.8 [9.3] µg/ml compared to those without (18.5 [8.6] µg/ml, p = 0.018) and associated with a significant increased risk of fracture (HR 1.032, 95{\%} CI 1.003-1.063, p = 0.032). Leptin was not associated with BMD or fracture risk after adjustment. Adiponectin was independently associated with AAC (p = 0.007) and significantly higher in women with AAC scores {\textgreater} 1; (19.2[9.2]) compared to those with no or low AAC scores ({\textless}1); 16.8 [8.0], p = 0.018). In adjusted analyses, PWV velocity was positively associated with circulating vaspin (p = 0.039) and AI was negatively associated with serum leptin (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Adiponectin, leptin, vaspin are related to markers of bone and vascular health and may contribute to the observed association between osteoporosis and CVD.},

abstract = {Glycidol fatty acid esters (GEs) have been found as impurities in refined edible oils including diacylglycerol (DAG) oil, and concerns of possible exposure to glycidol (G), a known animal carcinogen, during digestion have been raised. We previously measured N-(2,3-dihydroxy-propyl)valine (diHOPrVal), a G hemoglobin adduct, for DAG oil exposed and non-exposed groups and showed there was no significant difference between them. In the present study, we conducted an additional analysis to verify the outcome of the previous report. The first experiment was designed as a matched case-control study to adjust variables with an increased sample size. The average levels of diHOPrVal were 6.9. pmol/g-globin (95{\%}CI: 4.9-9.0) for 14 DAG oil exposed subjects and 7.3 pmol/g-globin (95{\%}CI: 6.1-8.5) for 42 non-exposed volunteers, and no significant difference in levels was found between the two groups. In a second experiment, we compared the adduct levels of 12 DAG oil exposed subjects before and after discontinuing use of DAG oil, and found there was no significant change in diHOPrVal levels (from 7.1 ± 1.1 to 7.5 ± 1.4. pmol/g-globin). These results suggest that there was no increased exposure to G for humans who ingested DAG oil daily, although the evaluated population was limited. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and aim: Metabolic syndrome (MS) carries an increased risk for cardiovascular events and there is a growing awareness that large artery stiffening is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the relationship of MS with aortic stiffness. The aim of our study was to analyze, in patients with essential hypertension, the influence of MS, defined according to the criteria proposed by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP-ATP III), on carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of aortic stiffness. Methods: Ninety-three untreated essential hypertensives, aged between 23 and 61 years, without diabetes mellitus, were studied. All subjects underwent routine blood chemistry, oral glucose tolerance test with glucose and insulin determinations, albumin excretion rate (AER) measurement, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and measurement of carotid-femoral PWV, by means of a computerized method. Results: Patients with MS (n = 28) showed higher age-adjusted carotid-femoral PWV (10.1 ± 1.4 vs 9.3 ± 1.4 m/s; p = 0.01) when compared to subjects without MS. This difference held after controlling for gender and for 24-h mean blood pressure (MBP) (p = 0.02) and lost its statistical significance after further adjustment for AER. In a multiple regression model, excluding the individual components of MS, in which metabolic syndrome was added along with age, gender, smoking habit, LDL cholesterol, HOMA index, 24-h MBP and 24-h heart rate, MS remained independently associated with carotid-femoral PWV ($\beta$ = 0.29; p = 0.002). The statistical significance of this association disappeared after the inclusion into this model of AER. Conclusions: Metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased aortic stiffness. Main explanatory factors of this association are age, systolic blood pressure and albumin excretion rate. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Optical tomographic imaging requires an accurate forward model as well as regularization to mitigate missing-data artifacts and to suppress noise. Nonlinear forward models can provide more accurate interpretation of the measured data than their linear counterparts, but they generally result in computationally prohibitive reconstruction algorithms. Although sparsity-driven regularizers significantly improve the quality of reconstructed image, they further increase the computational burden of imaging. In this paper, we present a novel iterative imaging method for optical tomography that combines a nonlinear forward model based on the beam propagation method (BPM) with an edge-preserving three-dimensional (3-D) total variation (TV) regularizer. The central element of our approach is a time-reversal scheme, which allows for an efficient computation of the derivative of the transmitted wave-field with respect to the distribution of the refractive index. This time-reversal scheme together with our stochastic proximal-gradient algorithm makes it possible to optimize under a nonlinear forward model in a computationally tractable way, thus enabling a high-quality imaging of the refractive index throughout the object. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through several experiments on simulated and experimentally measured data.},

abstract = {A new method to image and quantify intra-abdominal haemorrhage using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was tested in vivo. Supine peritoneal dialysis patients were monitored using an 8-electrode hemiarray placed on the anterior abdomen. EIT measurements were recorded using the EPack II data acquisition system before, during, and after the administration of dialysate. The amount of dialysate infused was recorded synchronous with EIT measurements and used as a control. Tomographic images of impedance change were reconstructed using a weighted, sensitivity-based method and then post-processed to obtain a quantitative estimate of the total dialysate volume added and the rate of dialysate administration. Our preliminary study included two subjects, one male and one female, each of whom participated for two sessions spaced about 6 months apart. Data collected from these sessions indicated that with an in vivo SNR of about 35 dB the EPack II can detect accumulations larger than about 100 ml, with a quantification uncertainty of about 50 ml. The rate of accumulation was determined in less than 2 min. This method shows promise for automated detection of other pathologies, eg ascites, and is adaptable to detecting conductive accumulations in other anatomy.},

Thus, we tested whether striatal activation in response to food intake is related to current and future increases in body mass and whether these relations are moderated by the presence of the A1 allele of the TaqIA restriction fragment length polymorphism, which is associated with dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene binding in the striatum and compromised striatal dopamine signaling. Cross-sectional and prospective data from two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies support these hypotheses, which implies that individuals may overeat to compensate for a hypofunctioning dorsal striatum, particularly those with genetic polymorphisms thought to attenuate dopamine signaling in this region.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Regional fat is increasingly recognized as a determinant of bone mineral density (BMD), an association that may be mediated by adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, and inflammatory fat products. Chronic inflammation is deleterious to bone, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) predicts inflammatory markers such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin, whereas sc adipose tissue (SAT) and VAT predict IL-6 in adolescents. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine associations of regional fat mass and adipokines with BMD. We hypothesized that girls with greater VAT relative to SAT would have lower bone density mediated by inflammatory cytokines, adiponectin, and leptin. DESIGN This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING The study was conducted at a clinical research center. SUBJECTS SUBJECTS included 30 girls (15 obese, 15 normal weight) 12-18 yr old, matched for maturity (bone age), race, and ethnicity. OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed regional fat (SAT, VAT) using magnetic resonance imaging, total fat, and BMD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Fasting leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were obtained. RESULTS Mean body mass index sd score was 3.7 +/- 1.5 in obese subjects and 0.1 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2) in controls. VAT was a negative predictor of spine BMD and bone mineral apparent density, whole-body BMD and bone mineral content/height in obese girls and whole-body BMD and bone mineral content/height for the group as a whole after controlling for SAT, as was the ratio of VAT to SAT. In a regression model that included VAT/SAT, adipokines, and cytokines, E-selectin and adiponectin were negative predictors of BMD and leptin a positive predictor. CONCLUSION VAT is an independent inverse determinant of bone density in obesity. This association may be mediated by adipokines and a chronic inflammatory state.},

abstract = {Bariatric surgery results in rapid weight loss and beneficial metabolic effects, but may have negative effects on the skeleton. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate changes in bone metabolism in response to bariatric surgery with two surgical techniques. 46 morbidly obese subjects (mean 44.9 years, BMI 42.1) with (n = 19) or without (n = 27) type 2 diabetes (T2DM) at baseline underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 21) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n = 25). Bone turnover markers (CTX, PINP, TRAcP5b, TotalOC and ucOC) were measured before and six months after surgery. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at lumbar spine and vertebral bone marrow (VBM) fat were measured in 21 subjects (7 RYGB and 14 SG) with three-dimensional quantitative computer tomography and1H MR spectroscopy, respectively. 25 non-obese subjects were recruited as controls (mean 45.8 years, BMI 23.0) and assessed at a single cross-sectional visit. Obese subjects had significantly lower bone turnover at baseline when compared to non-obese controls. Bone metabolic markers markedly increased post-operatively (p {\textless} 0.0001 for all). The activation of bone remodeling was significantly higher after RYGB than after SG and was particularly observed in patients, whose type 2 diabetes was in remission after weight loss. There was no change in volumetric BMD or marrow fat at lumbar spine six months after surgery in our sample. In conclusion, severe obesity decreases bone remodeling, which is activated after bariatric surgery. The increase in bone turnover after surgery is affected by the choice of surgical technique and by the post-surgery remission of T2DM.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Obesity and diabetes are increasing in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of obesity and diabetes among US adults in 2001. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Random-digit telephone survey of 195 005 adults aged 18 years or older residing in all states participating in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index, based on self-reported weight and height and self-reported diabetes. RESULTS: In 2001 the prevalence of obesity (BMI {\textgreater} or =30) was 20.9{\%} vs 19.8{\%} in 2000, an increase of 5.6{\%}. The prevalence of diabetes increased to 7.9{\%} vs 7.3{\%} in 2000, an increase of 8.2{\%}. The prevalence of BMI of 40 or higher in 2001 was 2.3{\%}. Overweight and obesity were significantly associated with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, arthritis, and poor health status. Compared with adults with normal weight, adults with a BMI of 40 or higher had an odds ratio (OR) of 7.37 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 6.39-8.50) for diagnosed diabetes, 6.38 (95{\%} CI, 5.67-7.17) for high blood pressure, 1.88 (95{\%} CI,1.67-2.13) for high cholesterol levels, 2.72 (95{\%} CI, 2.38-3.12) for asthma, 4.41 (95{\%} CI, 3.91-4.97) for arthritis, and 4.19 (95{\%} CI, 3.68-4.76) for fair or poor health. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in obesity and diabetes among US adults continue in both sexes, all ages, all races, all educational levels, and all smoking levels. Obesity is strongly associated with several major health risk factors.},

abstract = {Context: The relationship between testosterone and diabetes in men is an important issue, given that one third of U.S. men aged 65 yr or older have diabetes, with a similar percentage having low testosterone levels. Evidence Acquisition: The medical literature from 1970 to March 2011 was reviewed for key articles. Evidence Synthesis: In population-based studies, low testosterone is commonly associated with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and it identifies men with an adverse metabolic profile. The difference in testosterone levels between men with diabetes compared to men without diabetes is moderate and comparable in magnitude to the effects of other chronic diseases, suggesting that low testosterone may be a marker of poor health. Although the inverse association of testosterone with diabetes is partially mediated by SHBG, low testosterone is linked to diabetes via a bidirectional relationship with visceral fat, muscle, and possibly bone. There is consistent evidence from randomized trials that testosterone therapy alters body composition in a metabolically favorable manner, but changes are modest and have not consistently translated into reductions in insulin resistance or improvements in glucose metabolism. Conclusions: The key response to the aging, overweight man with type 2 diabetes and subnormal testosterone levels should be implementation of lifestyle measures such as weight loss and exercise, which, if successful, raise testosterone and provide multiple health benefits. Although approved therapy for diabetes should be used, testosterone therapy should not be given to such men until benefits and risks are clarified by adequately powered clinical trials.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of brain imaging technologies has led to intense neuroscientific inquiry into the human brain. Studies often investigate brain function related to emotion, cognition, language, memory, and numerous other externally induced stimuli as well as resting-state brain function. Studies also use brain imaging in an attempt to determine the functional or structural basis for psychiatric or neurological disorders and, with respect to brain function, to further examine the responses of these disorders to treatment. Neuroimaging is a highly interdisciplinary field, and statistics plays a critical role in establishing rigorous methods to extract information and to quantify evidence for formal inferences. Neuroimaging data present numerous challenges for statistical analysis, including the vast amounts of data collected from each individual and the complex temporal and spatial dependence present. We briefly provide background on various types of neuroimaging data and analysis objectives that are commonly targeted in the field. We present a survey of existing methods targeting these objectives and identify particular areas offering opportunities for future statistical contribution.},

abstract = {Abstract The objective of the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software project is to develop freely available software that can be used to reconstruct electrical or optical material properties from boundary measurements. Nonlinear and ill posed problems such as electrical impedance and optical tomography are typically approached using a finite element model for the forward calculations and a regularized nonlinear solver for obtaining a unique and stable inverse solution. Most of the commercially available finite element programs are unsuitable for solving these problems because of their conventional inefficient way of calculating the Jacobian, and their lack of accurate electrode modelling. A complete package for the two-dimensional EIT problem was officially released by Vauhkonen et al at the second half of 2000. However most industrial and medical electrical imaging problems are fundamentally three-dimensional. To assist the development we have developed and released a free toolkit of Matlab routines which can be employed to solve the forward and inverse EIT problems in three dimensions based on the complete electrode model along with some basic visualization utilities, in the hope that it will stimulate further development. We also include a derivation of the formula for the Jacobian (or sensitivity) matrix based on the complete electrode model.},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue that plays a central role in human health and disease. Aging is associated with a decrease in muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) that is associated with a loss of independence and reduced quality of life. Gut microbiota, the bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotic microbes residing in the gastrointestinal tract are emerging as a potential contributor to age-associated muscle decline. Specifically, advancing age is characterized by a dysbiosis of gut microbiota that is associated with increased intestinal permeability, facilitating the passage of endotoxin and other microbial products (e.g., indoxyl sulfate) into the circulation. Upon entering the circulation, LPS and other microbial factors promote inflammatory signaling and skeletal muscle changes that are hallmarks of the aging muscle phenotype. This review will summarize existing literature suggesting cross-talk between gut microbiota and skeletal muscle health, with emphasis on the significance of this axis for mediating changes in aging skeletal muscle size, composition, and function.},

abstract = {A new contactless technique for electrical impedance imaging, using an eddy current managed along with the tetrapolar circuit method, is proposed. The eddy current produced by a magnetic field is superimposed on a constant current that is normally used in the tetrapolar circuit method, and thus is used to control the current distribution in the body. By changing the current distribution, a set of voltage differences is measured with a pair of electrodes. This set of voltage differences is used in the image reconstruction of the resistivity distribution. The least square error minimization method is used in the reconstruction algorithm. The principle of this method is explained theoretically. A backprojection algorithm was used to get 2-D images. Based on this principle, a measurement system was developed and model experiments were conducted with a saline-filled phantom. The estimated shape of each model in the reconstructed image was similar to that of the corresponding model. From the results of these experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed method is applicable to the realization of electrical conductivity imaging.},

@article{Kremer2009,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: In recent years, health concerns related to salt/sodium chloride consumption have caused an increased demand for salt-reduced foods. Consequently, sodium chloride (NaCl) reduction in foods has become an important challenge. The more so, since a decrease in NaCl content is often reported to be associated with a decrease in consumer acceptance. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether or not it would be possible to reduce the NaCl content in standard Western European foods by replacing it with naturally brewed soy sauce. Three types of foods were investigated: salad dressing (n = 56), soup (n = 52), and stir-fried pork (n = 57). In the 1st step, an exchange rate (ER) by which NaCl can be replaced with soy sauce without a significant change in the overall taste intensity was established per product type, by means of alternative forced choice tests. In the 2nd step, the same consumers evaluated 5 samples per product type with varying NaCl and/or soy sauce content on pleasantness and several sensory attributes. The results showed that it was possible to achieve a NaCl reduction in the tested foods of, respectively, 50{\%}, 17{\%}, and 29{\%} without leading to significant losses in either overall taste intensity or product pleasantness. These results suggest that it is possible to replace NaCl in foods with naturally brewed soy sauce without lowering the overall taste intensity and to reduce the total NaCl content in these foods without decreasing their consumer acceptance. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Health concerns related to salt consumption cause an increased demand for salt-reduced foods. Consequently, the development of foods with reduced salt content without decreasing the consumer acceptance is an important challenge for the food industry. A new possible salt reduction approach is described in the present article: The replacement of salt with naturally brewed soy sauce.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that hyperlipidemia contributes to the progression of renal disease. A large trial has not been performed; however, a number of small, controlled trials have been reported. We examined the effects of antilipemic agents on glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria or albuminuria in patients with renal disease. METHODS: We used Medline, abstracts from scientific meetings, and bibliographies from recent reviews and scientific reports to locate pertinent studies. Thirteen prospective controlled trials examining the effects of antilipemic agents on renal function, proteinuria, or albuminuria were included. Studies were published as full reports or abstracts and were at least three months in duration. For five of the studies, individual patient data were obtained. Other summary data were independently extracted from the published reports by two investigators and included study quality, subject characteristics, cause of renal disease, change in serum cholesterol, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and albuminuria. RESULTS: There was a lower rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate with treatment compared with controls (treated controls, 0.156 mL/min/month; 95{\%} CI, 0.026 to 0. 285 mL/min/month, P = 0.008). The study results were statistically homogeneous, and in a regression analysis, the effect of treatment on glomerular filtration rate did not correlate with study quality, the percentage change in cholesterol, the type of lipid-lowering agent, or the cause of renal disease. However, longer follow-up correlated with the amount of improvement in glomerular filtration rate from treatment (P = 0.007). There was a tendency for a favorable effect of treatment on protein or albumin excretion [Ln (treatment) - Ln (control) = -0.248, 95{\%} CI, -0.562 to 0.064, P = 0. 077]. However, these results were statistically heterogeneous between studies (P {\textless} 0.001). No obvious explanation for this heterogeneity was apparent in a regression analysis examining potential reasons for differences in study results. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid reduction may preserve glomerular filtration rate and may decrease proteinuria in patients with renal disease.},

Twenty-two Japanese participants (10 men, 12 women) aged 60-73 y were assigned to one of two groups (11 [5 men, 6 women] in each). One group received MFGM tablets (1 g MFGM/d), and the other received placebo tablets daily for 10 wk. Both groups participated in a twice-weekly light exercise program. Physical function tests and surface electromyography (EMG) were conducted at the baseline and after 5 and 10 wk. Chair stand time significantly shortened in both groups after 10 wk compared with that at the baseline. The average time shortened more considerably in the MFGM group than in the placebo group, although the change was not statistically significant. Both knee extension strength and the cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscles significantly increased from baseline in the MFGM group but not in the placebo group. Surface EMG showed that muscle fiber conduction velocity increased significantly after 10 wk from the baseline only in the MFGM group. The increase from the baseline was significantly greater in the MFGM group than in the placebo group. Daily supplementation with MFGM increased motor unit action potential conduction and improved muscle strength and physical performance in healthy Japanese adults aged 60 y and over paired with semiweekly light exercise.},

abstract = {The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a practical clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for age-related sarcopenia. EWGSOP included representatives from four participant organisations, i.e. the European Geriatric Medicine Society, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics—European Region and the International Association of Nutrition and Aging. These organisations endorsed the findings in the final document. The group met and addressed the following questions, using the medical literature to build evidence-based answers: (i) What is sarcopenia? (ii) What parameters define sarcopenia? (iii) What variables reflect these parameters, and what measurement tools and cut-off points can be used? (iv) How does sarcopenia relate to cachexia, frailty and sarcopenic obesity? For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass + low muscle function (strength or performance). EWGSOP variously applies these characteristics to further define conceptual stages as ‘presarcopenia', ‘sarcopenia' and ‘severe sarcopenia'. EWGSOP reviewed a wide range of tools that can be used to measure the specific variables of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Our paper summarises currently available data defining sarcopenia cut-off points by age and gender; suggests an algorithm for sarcopenia case finding in older individuals based on measurements of gait speed, grip strength and muscle mass; and presents a list of suggested primary and secondary outcome domains for research. Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment.},

abstract = {Background and aim: Coffee is rich in chlorogenic acids (CGA), whose metabolites may have beneficial effects such as anti-hypertensive effects. However, trial results concerning the effects of coffee on blood pressure (BP) are not consistent. A recent study suggested that hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ), produced by the roasting of green coffee beans, inhibits the effect of CGA. In the present study, the dose-response for CGA in HHQ-free coffee on BP were investigated in mildly hypertensive men and women. Methods and results: The trial design was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, with five study groups including, control, zero-dose, low-dose, middle-dose and high-dose. The control beverage was identical to ordinary coffee. The others contained reduced HHQ levels, compared to ordinary coffee, and the CGA were adjusted in target concentration. A total of 203 subjects were randomly allocated. Each subject drank one cup of coffee per day. The study involved a screening and a baseline observation period of 6 weeks and an intervention period of 4 weeks. BP response showed CGA has an anti-hypertensive effect in a dose-dependent manner in HHQ-free coffee, and ordinary coffee showed almost no effect. As a result, a significant correlation between BP change and the three dose-response patterns was observed (p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a dose-dependent decrease in BP for CGA in HHQ-free coffee. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We demonstrate that ggplot2 can be used as the basis for producing specialized plotting packages and, in the present case, a package has been developed specifically for the production of high quality ternary diagrams. In order to produce ggtern, it was necessary to overcome a number of design issues, such as finding a means to modify existing geometries designed for a 2D Cartesian coordinate system and permitting them to function in an environment that requires an additional spatial aesthetic mapping. In the present paper, we provide examples of this package in its most basic form followed by a demonstration of its ease of use, particularly if one is familiar with, and has a predilection towards using ggplot2 on a regular basis.},

In this fMRI investigation we report a significant correlation between the activation of a region of the human orbitofrontal cortex and the decrease in subjective pleasantness when a liquid food is eaten to satiety. Moreover, a cluster of voxels in the orbitofrontal cortex showed a decrease in its activation that was specific to the particular liquid food consumed in a meal, providing a neural correlate of sensory-specific satiety to a liquid whole food in humans. This sensory-specific reduction in activation of the orbitofrontal cortex correlating with subjective pleasantness is consistent with an important role for the orbitofrontal cortex in human emotion and motivation, and associated subjective states.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Trials comparing the effectiveness and safety of weight-loss diets are frequently limited by short follow-up times and high dropout rates. METHODS In this 2-year trial, we randomly assigned 322 moderately obese subjects (mean age, 52 years; mean body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31; male sex, 86{\%}) to one of three diets: low-fat, restricted-calorie; Mediterranean, restricted-calorie; or low-carbohydrate, non-restricted-calorie. RESULTS The rate of adherence to a study diet was 95.4{\%} at 1 year and 84.6{\%} at 2 years. The Mediterranean-diet group consumed the largest amounts of dietary fiber and had the highest ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat (P{\textless}0.05 for all comparisons among treatment groups). The low-carbohydrate group consumed the smallest amount of carbohydrates and the largest amounts of fat, protein, and cholesterol and had the highest percentage of participants with detectable urinary ketones (P{\textless}0.05 for all comparisons among treatment groups). The mean weight loss was 2.9 kg for the low-fat group, 4.4 kg for the Mediterranean-diet group, and 4.7 kg for the low-carbohydrate group (P{\textless}0.001 for the interaction between diet group and time); among the 272 participants who completed the intervention, the mean weight losses were 3.3 kg, 4.6 kg, and 5.5 kg, respectively. The relative reduction in the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 20{\%} in the low-carbohydrate group and 12{\%} in the low-fat group (P=0.01). Among the 36 subjects with diabetes, changes in fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels were more favorable among those assigned to the Mediterranean diet than among those assigned to the low-fat diet (P{\textless}0.001 for the interaction among diabetes and Mediterranean diet and time with respect to fasting glucose levels). CONCLUSIONS Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets may be effective alternatives to low-fat diets. The more favorable effects on lipids (with the low-carbohydrate diet) and on glycemic control (with the Mediterranean diet) suggest that personal preferences and metabolic considerations might inform individualized tailoring of dietary interventions.

abstract = {This chapter describes small-study effects in meta-analysis and how the issues they raise may be addressed. ``Small-study effects'' is a generic term for the phenomenon that smaller studies sometimes show different, often larger, treatment effects than large ones. This notion was coined by Sterne et al. [55]. One possible, probably the most well-known, reason is publication bias. This is said to occur when the chance of a smaller study being published is increased if it shows a stronger effect [3, 41, 52]. This can happen for a number of reasons, for example authors may be more likely to submit studies with ``significant'' results for publication or journals may be more likely to publish smaller studies if they have ``significant'' results. If this occurs, it in turn biases the results of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. There are a number of other possible reasons for small-study effects. One is selective reporting of the most favourable outcomes, known as outcome selection bias or outcome reporting bias [8, 9, 18, 61]. Another possible cause of small-study effects is clinical heterogeneity between patients in large and small studies; e.g., patients in smaller studies may have been selected so that a favourable outcome of the experimental treatment may be expected. In the case of a binary outcome, also a mathematical artefact arises from the fact that for the odds ratio or the risk ratio, the variance of the treatment effect estimate is not independent of the estimate itself [47]. This problem will be discussed in Sect. 5.2.2. Lastly, it can never be ruled out that small-study effects result from mere coincidence [42]. Empirical studies have established evidence for these and other kinds of bias [19, 42, 53]. There is a vast range of tests for small-study effects [4, 20, 24, 38, 43, 48], most of them based on a funnel plot which will be introduced in Sect. 5.1.1.},

Within the study area, 800 subjects developed herpes zoster and 412 were eligible for the study. Herpes zoster incidence was 10.2/1000 person-years and higher among women and older subjects. Subjects with herpes zoster required on average 5.7 outpatient consultations. Herpes zoster-associated hospitalization rate was 3.4{\%} (27/800). The proportion of postherpetic neuralgia and other complications was 9.2{\%} (38/412) and 26.5{\%} (109/412), respectively. Statistically significant association with the development of postherpetic neuralgia was male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.17-5.38), age of 70-74 years (OR, 3.51; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-11.3), immunosuppressive therapy (OR, 6.44; 95{\%} CI, 1.26-32.9), severe herpes zoster pain at first consultation (OR, 3.08; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-8.62) and rash on upper arms (vs no rash on upper arms; OR, 3.46; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-10.9).

Aortic stiffness is an important factor for cardiovascular system performance and a prognosticator of cardiovascular risk. We investigated the effect of caffeine on aortic stiffness in treated hypertensive patients. Methods: We studied the effect of caffeine (250 mg) in 12 treated hypertensive patients according to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design during a 3-h period, Aortic stiffness was evaluated by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, Results: Systolic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure increased significantly throughout the study (by 12.3 and 7.4 mm Hg, P = .005 and P {\textless} .01, respectively), whereas diastolic BP did not change. Pulse wave velocity increased (by 0.57 m/sec, P {\textless} .05) denoting an increase in aortic stiffness. This effect of caffeine lasted throughout the study (3 h), peaking at 60 min and decreasing progressively thereafter, Conclusions: These results demonstrate, for the first time, that caffeine exerts an acute unfavorable effect on aortic stiffness in treated hypertensive patients.

abstract = {The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is a weak potential or magnetic response elicited by periodic acoustic stimuli with a maximum response at about a 40-Hz periodicity. In most previous studies using amplitude-modulated (AM) tones of stimulus sound, long lasting tones of more than 10 s in length were used. However, characteristics of the ASSR elicited by short AM tones have remained unclear. In this study, we examined magnetoencephalographic (MEG) ASSR using a sequence of sinusoidal AM tones of 0.78 s in length with various tone frequencies of 440-990 Hz in about one octave variation. It was found that the amplitude of the ASSR was invariant with tone frequencies when the level of sound pressure was adjusted along an equal-loudness curve. The amplitude also did not depend on the existence of preceding tone or difference in frequency of the preceding tone. When the sound level of AM tones was changed with tone frequencies in the same range of 440-990 Hz, the amplitude of ASSR varied in a proportional manner to the sound level. These characteristics are favorable for the use of ASSR in studying temporal processing of auditory information in the auditory cortex. The lack of adaptation in the ASSR elicited by a sequence of short tones may be ascribed to the neural activity of widely accepted generator of magnetic ASSR in the primary auditory cortex. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background. The purpose of this study was to use the meta-analytic approach to examine the effects of walking on lipids and lipoproteins in adults. Methods. Randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of walking on total cholesterol (TC), high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C), the ratio of TC/HDL, and triglycerides (TG) in adults ages 18 years and older were retrieved via computerized literature searches, cross-referencing, hand-searching, and expert review of our reference list. Results. Twenty-five studies that included 1,176 subjects (692 walkers, 484 controls) and up to 33 outcomes were available for pooling. Using random-effects modeling, statistically significant, walking-induced decreases of 5{\%} and 6{\%} were observed for LDL-C and TC/HDL-C (LDL-C, mean ± SE, -5. 5 ± 2.2 mg/dL, 95{\%} CI, -9.9 to -1.2 mg/dL; TC/HDL-C, mean ± SE, -0.3 ± 0.1, 95{\%} CI, -0.6 to -0.1). No statistically significant changes were observed for TC, HDL, or TG (P {\textgreater} 0.05), although changes were in the direction of benefit. No statistically significant changes occurred in body composition (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusions. Walking reduces LDL-C and TC/HDL-C in adults independent of changes in body composition. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

While various approaches for this problem were proposed, here an approach based on the isometric logratio (ilr) transformation is used. It turns out that the resulting model is easy to handle, and that parameter estimation can be done in like in usual linear regression. Moreover, it is possible to use the ilr variables for inference statistics in order to obtain an appropriate interpretation of the model.},

abstract = {Numerous applications have been reported for the stereotactic mapping of focal changes in cerebral blood flow during sensory and cognitive activation as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) subtraction images. Since these images lack significant anatomical information, analysis of these kinds of data has been restricted to an automated search for peaks in the PET subtraction dataset and localization of the peak coordinates within a standardized stereotactic atlas. This method is designed to identify isolated foci with dimensions smaller than the image resolution. Details of activation patterns that may extend over finite distances, following the underlying anatomical structures, will not be apparent. We describe the combined mapping into stereotactic coordinate space of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET information from each of a set of subjects such that the major features of the activation pattern, particularly extended tracts of increased blood flow, can be immediately assessed within their true anatomical context as opposed to that presumed using a standard atlas alone. Near areas of high anatomical variability, e. g., central sulcus, or of sharp curvature, e. g., frontal and temporal poles, this information can be essential to the localization of a focus to the correct gyrus or for the rejection of extracerebral peaks. It also allows for the removal from further analysis of data from cognitively-normal subjects with abnormal anatomy such as enlarged ventricles. In patients with neuropathology, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, arteriovenous malformation, stroke, or neoplasm, the use of correlated MRI is mandatory for correct localization of functional activation. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Green tea catechins have been shown to attenuate obesity in animals and humans. The catechins activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and thereby increase fatty acid oxidation in liver and skeletal muscles. Green tea catechins have also been shown to reduce body fat in humans. However, the effect of the catechins on lipolysis in adipose tissue has not been fully understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of green tea catechins on lipolysis in adipocytes and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Differentiated mouse adipocyte cell line (3T3-L1) was stimulated with green tea catechins in the presence or absence of norepinephrine. Glycerol and free fatty acids in the media were measured. Phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was determined by Western blotting, and the mRNA expression levels of HSL, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and perilipin were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The cells were treated with inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase G (PKG), or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to determine the responsible pathway. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with green tea catechins increased the level of glycerol and free fatty acids released into the media in the presence, but not absence, of norepinephrine, and increased the level of phosphorylated HSL in the cells. The catechins also increased mRNA and protein levels of HSL and ATGL. PKA inhibitor (H89) attenuated the catechin-induced increase in glycerol release and HSL phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that green tea catechins enhance lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine via a PKA-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, providing a potential mechanism by which green tea catechins could reduce body fat.},

abstract = {The Iberian pig is one of the scarce non-improved swine breeds which survives the modern techniques of pig production based on improved genotypes. This is attributed both to its perfect adaptation to the Mediterranean natural ecosystem and the high quality of its products. The production of meat products from Iberian pigs has very little in common with that of meat products obtained from selected pigs raised under intensive conditions, and it constitutes an example of the preparation of high quality meat products, comparable to the most exquisite food products in the world. The production of Iberian pig is deeply bound to the Mediterranean ecosystem. It is a rare example in the world swine production where the pig contributes so decisively to the preservation of the ecosystem. The aim of this review is to describe in detail the traditional feeding of the Iberian pigs in La Dehesa and to discuss some aspects of the use of alternatives to this production system. Some of the experience in the formulation of compounds feeds for Iberian pigs and in the processing of meat products could be useful in the feeding of other pig genotypes and in different meat processing strategies.},

To overcome the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, Tikhonov regularization (TIK) and truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) are commonly used by choosing the appropriate regularization parameter and truncation parameter, respectively. We have developed a minimal product method (MINP) to determine the regularization and truncation parameters. The present computer simulation and experimental results indicate that the MINP can be easily implemented in both TIK and TSVD with satisfactory performance, and suggest the potential applications of the MINP method in determining the corner of the L-curve.},

abstract = {We report on the generation of computer-based models for the prediction of the chromosome-damaging potential of chemicals as assessed in the in vitro chromosome aberration (CA) test. On the basis of publicly available CA-test results of more than 650 chemical substances, half of which are drug-like compounds, we generated two different computational models. The first model was realized using the (Q)SAR tool MCASE. Results obtained with this model indicate a limited performance (53{\%}) for the assessment of a chromosome-damaging potential (sensitivity), whereas CA-test negative compounds were correctly predicted with a specificity of 75{\%}. The low sensitivity of this model might be explained by the fact that the underlying 2D-structural descriptors only describe part of the molecular mechanism leading to the induction of chromosome aberrations, that is, direct drug-DNA interactions. The second model was constructed with a more sophisticated machine learning approach and generated a classification model based on 14 molecular descriptors, which were obtained after feature selection. The performance of this model was superior to the MCASE model, primarily because of an improved sensitivity, suggesting that the more complex molecular descriptors in combination with statistical learning approaches are better suited to model the complex nature of mechanisms leading to a positive effect in the CA-test. An analysis of misclassified pharmaceuticals by this model showed that a large part of the false-negative predicted compounds were uniquely positive in the CA-test but lacked a genotoxic potential in other mutagenicity tests of the regulatory testing battery, suggesting that biologically nonsignificant mechanisms could be responsible for the observed positive CA-test result. Since such mechanisms are not amenable to modeling approaches it is suggested that a positive prediction made by the model reflects a biologically significant genotoxic potential. An integration of the machine-learning model as a screening tool in early discovery phases of drug development is proposed.},

Studies of genetic polymorphisms for coffee metabolism were excluded.Results The umbrella review identified 201 meta-analyses of observational research with 67 unique health outcomes and 17 meta-analyses of interventional research with nine unique outcomes. Coffee consumption was more often associated with benefit than harm for a range of health outcomes across exposures including high versus low, any versus none, and one extra cup a day. There was evidence of a non-linear association between consumption and some outcomes, with summary estimates indicating largest relative risk reduction at intakes of three to four cups a day versus none, including all cause mortality (relative risk 0.83, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.83 to 0.88), cardiovascular mortality (0.81, 0.72 to 0.90), and cardiovascular disease (0.85, 0.80 to 0.90). High versus low consumption was associated with an 18{\%} lower risk of incident cancer (0.82, 0.74 to 0.89). Consumption was also associated with a lower risk of several specific cancers and neurological, metabolic, and liver conditions. Harmful associations were largely nullified by adequate adjustment for smoking, except in pregnancy, where high versus low/no consumption was associated with low birth weight (odds ratio 1.31, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.03 to 1.67), preterm birth in the first (1.22, 1.00 to 1.49) and second (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22) trimester, and pregnancy loss (1.46, 1.06 to 1.99). There was also an association between coffee drinking and risk of fracture in women but not in men.Conclusion Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded.},

abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarize evidence relating to efficacy and safety of health care interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, is not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement--a reporting guideline published in 1999--there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Although the metabolic abnormalities are often developed in Asians with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2, the characteristics of the non-obese Asians with metabolic abnormality have not been fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of insulin sensitivity in Japanese men with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study, we defined that hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia are cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF). We recruited the subjects who met the selection criteria as below; men with BMI of 21 to 23 kg/m2 and no CMRF (n=24), men with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2 and no CMRF (n=28), 1 CMRF (n=28), and {\textgreater}/=2 CMRF (n=14), and 20 overweight men with metabolic syndrome (OWMS). Insulin sensitivity (IS) and ectopic fat content in muscle and liver were measured by two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. RESULTS: Among subjects with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2, impaired IS in muscle, but not in liver, was found in those with even 1 CMRF, while impaired IS in both muscle and liver was observed in OWMS. Liver fat accumulation and elevated liver enzymes were associated with impaired IS in both muscle and liver in those subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Among Japanese men with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2, muscle insulin resistance was present in those with even one CMRF. In this population, liver fat accumulation and/or elevated liver enzymes could be a good marker for impaired IS in both muscle and liver.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although many Asian type 2 diabetic patients have been considered to be not obese and have low capacity of insulin secretion, the proportion of obese patients with visceral fat accumulation has increased in recent years. We found previously considerable number of Japanese non-obese subjects (body mass index (BMI) {\textless}25 kg/m2) with visceral fat accumulation and multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of the study was to investigate the difference in clinical features of type 2 diabetic patients with and without visceral fat accumulation, focusing on vascular complications and changes in BMI. METHODS: We enrolled 88 Japanese hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients. Abdominal obesity represented waist circumference (WC) of {\textgreater}=85 cm for males and {\textgreater}=90 cm for females (corresponding to visceral fat area of 100 cm2). Subjects were divided into two groups; with or without abdominal obesity. RESULTS: Hypertension, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases were significantly more in the patients with abdominal obesity. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the non-obese patients (BMI {\textless}25 kg/m2) with abdominal obesity were similar in obese patients (BMI {\textgreater}=25 kg/m2). The mean BMI of the patients with abdominal obesity was {\textless}25 kg/m2 at 20 years of age, but reached maximum to more than 30 kg/m2 in the course. Furthermore, substantial portion of the type 2 diabetic patients (52{\%} in males and 43{\%} in females) were not obese at 20 year-old (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m2), but developed abdominal obesity by the time of admission. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the need to control multiple risk factors and prevent atherosclerotic disease in patients with abdominal obesity. The significant weight gain after 20 years of age in patients with abdominal obesity stresses the importance of lifestyle modification in younger generation, to prevent potential development of type 2 diabetes and future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {The Health Professionals Follow-up Study is a prospective cohort study of 51 529 US male health professionals (dentists, optometrists, pharmacists, podiatrists, osteopathic doctors, and veterinarians) that began in 1986 to study the dietary etiologies of heart disease and cancer (6). The men were 40–75 y of age at baseline. Biennially, health information and disease status has been assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. The 466 men included in this analysis are a subset of the 18 225 male health professionals who volunteered to provide blood samples between 1993 and 1994. This subset was a random sample strat-ified by 7 types of reported alcohol consumption patterns (eg, light, binge, and abstaining) to examine the associations with biomarkers of CVD and diabetes in a different study. Participants were included in this study if they had not previously received a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, dia-betes mellitus, intermittent claudication, gastric or duodenal ulcers, gall bladder removal, liver disease, or any cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancer. The Health Professionals Follow-up Study was approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of Public Health. Blood collection and assessment of biomarkers Blood samples, preferably fasting, were requested and col-lected in EDTA-containing tubes and returned to our laboratory via overnight courier on ice packs in insulated containers. Of all the blood samples received, {\textgreater} 95{\%} arrived within 24 h of the blood draw. On arrival, {\textless} 15{\%} were slightly hemolyzed, {\textless} 3{\%} were moderately hemolyzed, {\textless} 1{\%} were lipemic, and {\textless} 0.5{\%} were not cooled. They were centrifuged at 700 ϫ g for 15 min at room temperature, dispensed as aliquots on ice, and stored in liq-uid nitrogen (Ϫ150 ЊC). Lipids and lipoproteins were measured by using a Hitachi 911 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis) at a labora-tory certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion–National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lipid Stan-dardization Program. Total plasma cholesterol (CV in our laboratory: 1.7{\%}) and triacylglycerol (CV in our laboratory: 1.8{\%}) were measured enzymatically. HDL cholesterol was measured by a colorimetric assay from Roche Diagnostics (CV at the concentrations of our samples: 1.7{\%}) and LDL choles-terol (CV in our laboratory: {\textless} 3.1{\%}) by a direct method from Genzyme Corporation (Cambridge, MA). Apolipoprotein A-I measurement was based on an immunonephelometric assay with a CV {\textless} 5{\%} in our laboratory. Lipoprotein(a) and C-reactive pro-tein were assayed with latex-enhanced immunotechniques that had CVs {\textless} 6{\%}. The detection threshold for C-reactive protein was 0.15 mg/L. Insulin and C-peptide were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St Charles, MO). This assay allows accurate assessment with little or no proinsulin and C-peptide cross-reactivity; the CV we obtained was {\textless} 10{\%}. Gly-cated hemoglobin (Hb A 1c) was measured with turbidometric immunoinhibition in red cells by using a Hitachi 911 analyzer. Our CVs for Hb A 1c values of 0.056 and 0.096 were {\textless} 2.5{\%}. Fib-rinogen was measured by the Clauss method with a CV of 2.6{\%}. Factor VII antigen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) anti-gen, and the von Willebrand factor were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay; the respective CVs were 3.0{\%}, 5.5{\%}, and 8.8{\%}. Leptin was measured by a radioimmunoassay (Linco Research; the intraassay CV was 4.3{\%} and the interassay CV was 8.3{\%}). Folate was measured by immunoassay (Abbott Lab-oratories, Abbott Park, IL) with CVs of 7.7{\%} for 1.1 nmol/L and 1.9{\%} for 35.8 nmol/L. Homocysteine was measured by HPLC with fluorometric detection; the intralaboratory CV was 3.3{\%} for 7 ␮mol/L and 2.9{\%} for 12 ␮mol/L.},

abstract = {We used positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 10 healthy volunteers performing a recognition memory task with food and non-food items. The biological salience of the food stimuli was manipulated by requiring subjects to fast before the experiment and eat to satiation at fixed time points during scanning. All subjects showed enhanced recognition of food stimuli (relative to non-food) in the fasting state. Satiation significantly reduced the memory advantage for food. Left amygdala rCBF covaried positively with recognition memory for food items, whereas rCBF in right anterior orbitofrontal cortex covaried with overall memory performance. Right posterior orbitofrontal rCBF covaried positively with hunger ratings during presentation of food items. Regression analysis of the neuroimaging data revealed that left amygdala and right lateral orbitofrontal rCBF covaried as a function of stimulus category (i.e., food vs non-food). These results indicate the involvement of amygdala and discrete regions of orbitofrontal cortex in the integration of perceptual (food), motivational (hunger), and cognitive (memory) processes in the human brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine the extent to which low-income African-American children's weight status, psychosocial characteristics and food-related behaviours are associated with that of their adult caregivers. METHODS Cross-sectional data from baseline evaluation of B'More Healthy Communities for Kids obesity prevention trial were used. Outcomes of interest were children's overweight and/or obesity status, food-related self-efficacy, knowledge, intentions and healthier/less healthy food acquisition scores. The primary exposures were adult caregiver's overweight and/or obesity status, their psychosocial factors and food acquisition scores. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations. RESULTS Children had higher odds of overweight or obesity if they had an overweight/obese caregiver (odds ratio [OR] 4.04, 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%}CI] 1.59-10.28) or an obese caregiver (OR 2.50, 95{\%}CI 1.39-4.51). Having a caregiver in the highest quartile of self-efficacy, food intentions and healthy food acquisition patterns was associated with higher odds of their child also having a higher score on these factors (self-efficacy: OR 3.77 [95{\%}CI 1.76-8.04]; food intentions: OR 1.13 [95{\%}CI 1.01-1.27]; and healthy food acquisition: OR 2.19 [95{\%}CI 1.05-4.54]). CONCLUSIONS Child and adult caregiver weight status and psychosocial characteristics were positively associated in this low-income, urban population. These findings may help inform obesity treatment or prevention programmes and interventions aimed at parents and families.},

abstract = {It was previously believed that obesity and osteoporosis were two unrelated diseases, but recent studies have shown that both diseases share several common genetic and environmental factors. Body fat mass, a component of body weight, is one of the most important indices of obesity, and a substantial body of evidence indicates that fat mass may have beneficial effects on bone. Contrasting studies, however, suggest that excessive fat mass may not protect against osteoporosis or osteoporotic fracture. Differences in experimental design, sample structure, and even the selection of covariates may account for some of these inconsistent or contradictory results. Despite the lack of a clear consensus regarding the impact of effects of fat on bone, a number of mechanistic explanations have been proposed to support the observed epidemiologic and physiologic associations between fat and bone. The common precursor stem cell that leads to the differentiation of both adipocytes and osteoblasts, as well the secretion of adipocyte-derived hormones that affect bone development, may partially explain these associations. Based on our current state of knowledge, it is unclear whether fat has beneficial effects on bone. We anticipate that this will be an active and fruitful focus of research in the coming years.},

Five hundred and ten of the index patients tested positive for influenza A (subtype H3N2). A standardised daily questionnaire allowed for identification of secondary cases of influenza among their household contacts, who were followed-up for 15 days. Of the 395 (77{\%}) households that completed the questionnaire, we selected 279 where no additional cases had occurred on the day of the index patient's visit to the GP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Secondary cases of influenza were those household contacts who had developed clinical influenza within 5 days of the disease onset in the index patient. Hazard ratios for individual clinical and demographic characteristics of the contact and their index patient were derived from a Cox regression model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall in the 279 households, 131 (24.1{\%}) secondary cases occurred among the 543 household contacts. There was an increased risk of influenza transmission in preschool contacts (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 3.26) as compared with school-age and adult contacts. There was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients (HR = 1.93, 95{\%} CI = 1.09 to 3.42) and school-age index patients (HR = 1.68, 95{\%} CI = 1.07 to 2.65), compared with those exposed to adult index cases. No other factor was associated with transmission of the disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results support the major role of children in the dissemination of influenza in households. Vaccination of children or prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors would prevent, respectively, 32-38{\%} and 21-41{\%} of secondary cases caused by exposure to a sick child in the household.},

With some simplifying assumptions, the information from such multicenter studies may be divided into 1) estimated relationships within each of the separate cohorts, between individual-level measurements of dietary exposure and disease outcome, and 2) an estimated between-cohort relationship, between the mean intake measurements and mean incidence rates. Errors in the dietary exposure measurements may lead to different amounts of bias in each of these estimated relationships, in particular when dietary questionnaire methods cannot easily be standardized. A calibration approach can be used to adjust for such differences in bias.

abstract = {This in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation with different rates of euglena (Euglena gracilis) on nutrient intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and rumen fermentation. Four rumen cannulated Corriedale wethers sheep with an average body weight of 44.25 ± 3.86 kg were arranged in a 4 × 4 Latin square design and fed a basal diet of Guinea grass (Panicum maximum) hay and concentrate mixture at the maintenance level with four different rates of euglena (0, 50, 100 and 150 g/kg DM intake). The experiment was conducted over 80 days in four 20 day periods that consisted of 14 days of acclimatization, 5 days of measurement and 1 more day for rumen liquor sample collection. The data were subjected to polynomial regression analysis. Dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and gross energy (GE) intake increased linearly (P {\textless} 0.001) and quadratically (P = 0.002) with increasing concentrations of euglena. Similarly, crude protein (CP) intake was increased linearly (P {\textless} 0.001). Dry matter, OM, NDF, ADF and GE digestibility were not affected by supplementation of euglena (P {\textgreater} 0.11) while apparent CP digestibility increased linearly (P = 0.009). As a result, protein retention (g/d) was increased linearly (P {\textless} 0.001) and quadratically (P = 0.017) with increasing concentrations of euglena. Ruminal NH3-N concentration increased (linear, P {\textless} 0.001) while ruminal protozoa population reduced linear, quadratic and cubic (P {\textless} 0.008) with increasing doses of Euglena. Euglena supplementation at different concentration did not change (P {\textgreater} 0.23) the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration and the molar proportions of acetate, propionate, butyrate and the acetate: propionate ratio. The finding of this study indicated that the addition of euglena increased nutrient intake without affecting total tract digestibility. It has been also demonstrated that addition of euglena at a dose of 150 g/kg DM improved CP retention by 31{\%}, which may be associated with increased CP digestibility and efficiency of utilization. Thus, euglena supplementation up to 150 g/kg DM of the diet could be a possible option for substitution of protein and energy sources.},

abstract = {A clustering of metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, all of which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), occurs more often than by chance. Numerous epidemiological studies, as well as basic researches, have revealed that visceral fat accumulation is closely involved in this risk clustering. This morbid condition is now well recognized as the metabolic syndrome. The concept of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., the involvement of visceral adiposity in the clustering of CVD risk factors, implies that an effective CVD risk reduction will be accomplished by an intervention to reduce visceral fat deposits. The primary strategy of the intervention is lifestyle modification, which can be put into practice in healthcare fields, without necessity of medical treatment. Now that CVD is a leading global health burden, the metabolic syndrome attracts increasing attention in the world. To take global action against the syndrome, several working groups developed its internationally unified diagnostic criteria. Most recently, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) jointly proposed the criteria, although some cautions will be needed in their practical use. In this review, we mainly focus on the findings observed in clinical and epidemiological studies, to discuss a practical strategy of the management of the metabolic syndrome in healthcare fields.},

abstract = {It has been well documented that the frequency of vasomotor menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats, of Japanese menopausal women is less than that of Western women. High intake of soy isoflavones in the traditional Japanese diet has been postulated as the possible explanation of the difference. Epidemiological studies have reported that the content of equol, which is a biologically active metabolite of the isoflavone, daidzein, is lower in the women who complain of severe vasomotor symptoms. To investigate the involvement of equol in the manifestation of menopausal symptoms, especially vasomotor symptoms, and the possible therapeutic role of a supplement containing equol (natural S-equol developed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical) on the menopausal symptoms of Japanese women, 3 randomized clinical trials were conducted. The studies indicated that a daily dose of 10 mg of natural S-equol improved menopausal symptoms. In the confirmation study, menopausal women who were equol nonproducers who consumed 10 mg/d of natural S-equol for 12 wk had significantly reduced severity and frequency of hot flashes as well as a significant reduction in the severity of neck or shoulder stiffness. The equol-ingesting group also showed trends of improvement in sweating and irritability and a significant improvement in the somatic category symptoms. Thus, it is concluded that the supplement containing natural S-equol, a novel soybean-derived functional component, has a promising role as an alternative remedy in the management of menopausal symptoms.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a device for noninvasive local tissue electrical impedance tomography (EIT) using divided electrodes with guard electrodes and to validate its effectiveness using bioequivalent phantoms. For this purpose, we prepared a measurement device and bioequivalent phantoms, measured the electrical characteristics of the phantoms, and validated the method using the phantoms. Monolayer phantoms mimicking the brain and muscle and bilayer phantoms consisting of muscle and brain layers were prepared. The relative differences between the measured electrical conductivities of the monolayer brain and muscle phantoms and the true values determined by the 4-electrode method were both less than 10{\%}. The relative differences between the measured and true values in the bilayer phantoms were less than 20{\%} in both layers. The biological impedance measurement device that we developed was confirmed to be effective for impedance measurement in bilayer phantoms with different electrical impedances. To develop a device for the early diagnosis of breast diseases, the development of a multi-layer phantom and demonstration of the effectiveness of the device for its examination are necessary. If the device that we developed makes impedance measurement in breast tumors possible, it may be used as a new diagnostic modality for breast diseases.},

abstract = {There is a strong clinical demand for devices allowing continuous non-invasive monitoring of central blood pressure (BP). In the state of the art a new family of techniques providing BP surrogates based on the measurement of the so-called pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been proposed, eliminating the need for inflation cuffs. PWV is defined as the velocity at which pressure pulses propagate along the arterial wall. However, no technique to assess PWV within central arteries in a fully unsupervised manner has been proposed so far. In this pilot study, we provide first experimental evidence that electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is capable of measuring pressure pulses directly within the descending aorta. To obtain a wide range of BP values, we administrated noradrenalin and nitroglycerine to an anesthetized pig under mechanical ventilation. An arterial line was inserted into the ascending aorta for measuring reference BP. EIT images were generated from 32 impedance electrodes placed around the chest at the level of the axilla. Regions of Interest (ROI) such as the descending aorta and the lungs were automatically identified by a novel time-based processing algorithm as the respective EIT pixels representing these structures. The correct positions of these ROIs were confirmed by bolus injections of highly conductive concentrated saline into the right heart and into the ascending aorta. Aortic pulse transit time (PTT) values were determined as the delay between the opening of the aortic valve (obtained from arterial line) and the arrival of pressure pulses at the aortic ROI within the EIT plane. For 11 experimental conditions, with mean BP ranging from 73 to 141 mmHg, strongly significant correlation (r = -0.97, P {\textless} 0.00001) between central BP and aortic PTT was observed, suggesting that EIT-derived aortic PTT is a potential non-invasive surrogate of central BP. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

We sought to estimate the radiation dose associated with common CT studies in clinical practice and quantify the potential cancer risk associated with these examinations.Methods$\backslash$nWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study describing radiation dose associated with the 11 most common types of diagnostic CT studies performed on 1119 consecutive adult patients at 4 San Francisco Bay Area institutions in California between January 1 and May 30, 2008. We estimated lifetime attributable risks of cancer by study type from these measured doses.Results$\backslash$nRadiation doses varied significantly between the different types of CT studies. The overall median effective doses ranged from 2 millisieverts (mSv) for a routine head CT scan to 31 mSv for a multiphase abdomen and pelvis CT scan. Within each type of CT study, effective dose varied significantly within and across institutions, with a mean 13-fold variation between the highest and lowest dose for each study type. The estimated number of CT scans that will lead to the development of a cancer varied widely depending on the specific type of CT examination and the patient's age and sex. An estimated 1 in 270 women who underwent CT coronary angiography at age 40 years will develop cancer from that CT scan (1 in 600 men), compared with an estimated 1 in 8100 women who had a routine head CT scan at the same age (1 in 11 080 men). For 20-year-old patients, the risks were approximately doubled, and for 60-year-old patients, they were approximately 50{\%} lower.Conclusion$\backslash$nRadiation doses from commonly performed diagnostic CT examinations are higher and more variable than generally quoted, highlighting the need for greater standardization across institutions.},

The results demonstrated partial support for asymmetry accounts. Greater left-sided activity was observed for approach emotions, whereas neural activity associated with negative/withdrawal emotions was symmetrical. Support was also found for affect program emotion accounts. The activation distributions associated with fear, disgust, and anger differed significantly. These emotions were most consistently associated in activity in regions associated with selective processing deficits when damaged: the amygdala, the insula and globus pallidus, and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, respectively. In contrast, the distributions for happiness and sadness did not differ. These findings are considered in the context of conceptualizations of the neural correlates of human emotion.},

abstract = {Multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography has been evolving from the frequency-sweep approach to the multi-frequency simultaneous measurement technique which can reduce measuring time and will be increasingly attractive for time-varying biological applications. The accuracy and stability of the current source are the key factors determining the quality of the image reconstruction. This article presents a field programmable gate array-based current source for a multi-frequency simultaneous electrical impedance tomography system. A novel current source circuit was realized by combining the classic current mirror based on the feedback amplifier AD844 with a differential topology. The optimal phase offsets of harmonic sinusoids were obtained through the crest factor analysis. The output characteristics of this current source were evaluated by simulation and actual measurement. The results include the following: (1) the output impedance was compared with one of the Howland pump circuit in simulation, showing comparable performance at low frequencies. However, the proposed current source makes lower demands for resistor tolerance but performs even better at high frequencies. (2) The output impedance in actual measurement below 200 kHz is above 1.3 M$\Omega$ and can reach 250 K$\Omega$ up to 1 MHz. (3) An experiment based on a biological RC model has been implemented. The mean error for the demodulated impedance amplitude and phase are 0.192{\%} and 0.139°, respectively. Therefore, the proposed current source is wideband, biocompatible, and high precision, which demonstrates great potential to work as a sub-system in the multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography system.},

abstract = {To maintain nutritional homeostasis, external food-related stimuli have to be evaluated in relation to the internal states of hunger or satiety. To examine the neural circuitry responsible for integration of internal and external determinants of human eating behaviour, brain responses to visual and complex gustatory food-related stimuli were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 18 healthy non-smokers (10 women, 8 men). Each individual was studied on two occasions, the order of which was counterbalanced; after eating as usual and after 24 h fasting. Raised plasma free fatty acids and lower insulin and leptin concentrations confirmed that participants fasted as requested. When fasted, participants reported more hunger, nervousness and worse mood and rated the visual (but not gustatory) food-related stimuli as more pleasant. The effect of fasting on hunger was stronger in women than in men. No circuitry was identified as differentially responsive in fasting compared to satiety to both visual and gustatory food-related stimuli. The left insula response to the gustatory stimuli was stronger during fasting. The inferior occipito-temporal response to visual food-related stimuli also tended to be stronger during fasting. The responses in the occipito-temporal cortex to visual and in the insula to gustatory stimuli were stronger in women than in men. There was no interaction between gender and fasting. In conclusion, food reactivity in modality-specific sensory cortical areas is modulated by internal motivational states. The stronger reactivity to external food-related stimuli in women may be explored as a marker of gender-related susceptibility to eating disorders. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Walking is a preferred and recommended physical activity for middle-aged and older adults, but many barriers exist, including concerns about safety (ie, personal security), falling, and inclement weather. Mall walking programs may overcome these barriers. The purpose of this study was to summarize the evidence on the health-related value of mall walking and mall walking programs. METHODS We conducted a scoping review of the literature to determine the features, environments, and benefits of mall walking programs using the RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance). The inclusion criteria were articles that involved adults aged 45 years or older who walked in indoor or outdoor shopping malls. Exclusion criteria were articles that used malls as laboratory settings or focused on the mechanics of walking. We included published research studies, dissertations, theses, conference abstracts, syntheses, nonresearch articles, theoretical papers, editorials, reports, policy briefs, standards and guidelines, and nonresearch conference abstracts and proposals. Websites and articles written in a language other than English were excluded. RESULTS We located 254 articles on mall walking; 32 articles met our inclusion criteria. We found that malls provided safe, accessible, and affordable exercise environments for middle-aged and older adults. Programmatic features such as program leaders, blood pressure checks, and warm-up exercises facilitated participation. Individual benefits of mall walking programs included improvements in physical, social, and emotional well-being. Limited transportation to the mall was a barrier to participation. CONCLUSION We found the potential for mall walking programs to be implemented in various communities as a health promotion measure. However, the research on mall walking programs is limited and has weak study designs. More rigorous research is needed to define best practices for mall walking programs' reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance.},

METHODS AND RESULTS We evaluated 1249 participants of the Framingham Third Generation and Omni II cohorts (mean age 51.7 years, 47{\%} women) who underwent assessment of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with accelerometry over 5 to 7 days, and multi-detector computed tomography for measurement of SAT and VAT volume; fat attenuation was estimated by SAT and VAT hounsfield units (HU). In women, higher levels of MVPA were associated with decreased SAT (P{\textless}0.0001) and VAT volume (P{\textless}0.0001). The average decrement in VAT per 30 minute/day increase in MVPA was -453 cm(3) (95{\%} CI -574, -331). The association was attenuated but persisted upon adjustment for BMI (-122 cm(3), P=0.002). Higher levels of MVPA were associated with higher SAT HU (all P≤0.01), a marker of fat quality, even after adjustment for SAT volume. Similar findings were observed in men but the magnitude of the association was less. Sedentary time was not associated with SAT or VAT volume or quality in men or women. CONCLUSIONS MVPA was associated with less VAT and SAT and better fat quality.},

abstract = {Objective To develop an index of overall diet quality. Design The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was developed based on a 10-component system of five food groups, four nutrients, and a measure of variety in food intake. Each of the 10 components has a score ranging from 0 to 10, so the total possible index score is 100. Methods/subjects Data from the 1989 and 1990 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals were used to analyze the HEI for a representative sample of the US population. Statistical analyses performed Frequencies, correlation coefficients, means. Results The mean HEI was 63.9; most people scored neither very high nor very low. No one component of the index dominated the HEI score. People were most likely to do poorly in the fruit, saturated fat, grains, vegetable, and total fat categories. The HEI correlated positively and significantly with most nutrients; as the total HEI increased, intake for a range of nutrients also increased. Discussion/conclusions The HEI is a useful index of overall diet quality of the consumer. The US Department of Agriculture will use the HEI to monitor changes in dietary intake over time and as the basis of nutrition promotion activities for the population.

abstract = {The National Nutrition Survey in Japan (J-NNS), an annual nationwide survey on nutrition and diet of the Japanese people, is reviewed. J-NNS was started in the Tokyo Metropolitan area in 1945 following the end of World War II. The survey area was gradually expanded and became nationwide in 1948. The current survey obtains data from more than 12,000 persons of approximately 5,000 randomly selected households. The survey consists of three parts: a physical examination, a dietary intake survey and a dietary habit questionnaire. The physical examination includes anthropometric measurements and a blood test, the dietary intake survey examines nutrient/food intake with a semi-weighed recording method, and the dietary habit questionnaire monitors nutrition/diet-consciousness and dietary habits. In this review, the aim and brief history of the survey are outlined in the first section. The following section, explains its administrative framework, target population, sampling method, annual schedule and question items, focusing on their historical transition. Then the findings of the J-NNS are summarized, which highlights annual changes in the intake of energy, macronutrients, micronutrients and food groups. The current findings of the dietary habit questionnaire are also given in brief.},

Diabetes was induced in experimental rats weighing 180-220g, by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of STZ (45mg/kg BW), 15min after the (i.p.) administration of NA (110mg/kg BW). THC (80mg/kg BW) and CGA (5mg/kg BW) were orally administered to diabetic rats for a period of 45days. Fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) were significantly increased, whereas insulin, total haemoglobin (Hb), non-enzymic antioxidants (reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, vitamin E and ceruloplasmin) were decreased significantly in diabetic rats. Though the diabetic rats treated with THC and CGA individual exerts beneficial effects in all the biochemical parameters in (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The combined treatment with THC and CGA normalized all the above-mentioned biochemical parameters in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Normal pancreatic histological architecture in THC and CGA treated diabetic rats revealed that these phytochemical exert higher degree of protection when administered in combination than single treatment of individual compounds. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We developed an algorithm to automatically identify the body perimeter and the inner contour that separates visceral fat from subcutaneous fat. Diaphragmatic surfaces can be extracted by model-based segmentation to match the bottom surface of the lung in CT images for determination of the upper limitation of the abdomen. The functions for quantitative evaluation of abdominal obesity or obesity-related metabolic syndrome were implemented with a prototype three-dimensional (3D) image processing workstation. The volumetric ratios of visceral fat to total fat and visceral fat to subcutaneous fat for each subject can be calculated. Additionally, color intensity mapping of subcutaneous areas and the visceral fat layer is quite obvious in understanding the risk of abdominal obesity with the 3D surface display. Preliminary results obtained have been useful in medical checkups and have contributed to improved efficiency in checking obesity throughout the whole range of the abdomen with 3D visualization and analysis.},

We conducted a genome-wide association study of 5006 Caucasian individuals drawn from two cohorts of men: the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. We identified two independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with circulating retinol levels, which are located near the transthyretin (TTR) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) genes which encode major carrier proteins of retinol: rs1667255 (P =2.30× 10(-17)) and rs10882272 (P =6.04× 10(-12)). We replicated the association with rs10882272 in RBP4 in independent samples from the Nurses' Health Study and the Invecchiare in Chianti Study (InCHIANTI) that included 3792 women and 504 men (P =9.49× 10(-5)), but found no association for retinol with rs1667255 in TTR among women, thus suggesting evidence for gender dimorphism (P-interaction=1.31× 10(-5)). Discovery of common genetic variants associated with serum retinol levels may provide further insight into the contribution of retinol and other vitamin A compounds to the development of cancer and other complex diseases.},

abstract = {Objectives To compare the accuracy of abdominal visceral fat area (VFA) measurements between abdominal dual bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and whole-body BIA referenced to computed tomography (CT) measures. Methods Abdominal VFAs were measured in 102 individuals: 59 men and 43 women with a mean age of 44.2 ± 16.3 years (range 21 - 76), body mass index 23.9 ± 7.8 kg/m2(range 18 - 35) using a DUALSCAN HDS-2000 machine (dual abdominal BIA) and an InBody720 machine (whole-body BIA). The VFA values from each machine were compared with those from CT under various conditions. Results Mean abdominal VFAs were 116 ± 69 cm2by CT, 89 ± 47 cm2by dual abdominal BIA, and 84 ± 33 cm2by whole-body BIA. The former measure showed a higher correlation with the CT measure than the latter (r = 0.89 vs. r = 0.64, P {\textless} 0.001). Both BIA methods tended to underestimate abdominal VFAs compared with CT scans when CT VFA was not small. The dual abdominal BIA had less bias than the whole-body BIA in the assessment of VFAs. The whole-body BIA was affected by subcutaneous fat area. Conclusions Dual BIA was more accurate in assessing abdominal VFA than whole-body BIA.},

However there are various opinions on dry aging procedures and purveyors of such products are passionate about their programs. Recently, there has been an increased interest in dry aging process by a wider array of purveyors and retailers in the many countries. Dry aging process is very costly because of high aging shrinkage (6 to15 {\%}), trims loss (3 to 24 {\%}), risk of contamination and the requirement of highest grades meat with. The packaging in highly moisture-permeable bag may positively impact on safety, quality and shelf stability of dry aged beef. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration of the flavor that can only be described as " dry-aged beef " . But the contribution of flavor compounds of proteolysis and lipolysis to the cooked dry aged beef flavor is not fully known. Also there are limited scientific studies of aging parameters on the quality and palatability of dry aged beef.},

abstract = {Background: The mechanisms of skin breakdown induced by incontinence have been proposed from a variety of experimental studies. However, studies on the influence of skin properties caused by incontinence of bedridden subjects are very limited. Objective: This work was conducted to reveal how incontinence influences skin properties by comparing bedridden incontinent elderly subjects with age-matched healthy continent elderly and middle-aged subjects. Methods: Bedridden incontinent elderly subjects (n = 35, 83.5 +/- 9.7 years, mean age +/- SD), healthy continent elderly (n = 41, 75.9 +/- 5.6 years), and middle-aged (n = 20, 41.3 +/- 2.8 years) were recruited for this study. Skin surface pH, capacitance/hydration, transepidermal water loss, and bacteria on forearm and buttock skin were measured. Results: Hydration and transepidermal water loss values between healthy elderly subjects and incontinent elderly subjects were significantly different on buttock skin. Significant differences between those two groups were also observed regarding pH and total bacteria levels on buttock skin. The forearm skin showed no significant difference in these parameters. No significant influence was observed between with and without urination at the measurement time except for the pH of buttock skin. No significant correlation was observed except between pH and bacteria levels on buttock skin of incontinent elderly subjects. Conclusion: In this study, we clarified the characteristic features of skin induced by incontinence. Our results indicate that these parameters are adequate not only to evaluate the characteristic skin features of bedridden incontinent subjects but also to develop new diapers to avoid the diaper dermatitis caused by incontinence.},

abstract = {Adipocytes can highly and specifically express adiponectin, and the adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) has been detected in bone-forming cells. The present study was undertaken to investigate the action of adiponectin on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. AdipoR1 protein was detected in human osteoblasts. Adiponectin promoted osteoblast proliferation and resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin and type I collagen production, and an increase in mineralized matrix. Suppression of AdipoR1 with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the adiponectin-induced cell proliferation and ALP expression. Adiponectin induces activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), but not ERK1/2 in osteoblasts, and these effects were blocked by suppression of AdipoR1 with siRNA. Furthermore, pretreatment of osteoblasts with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished the adiponectin-induced cell proliferation. p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked the adiponectin-induced ALP activity. These data indicate that adiponectin induces human osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and the proliferation response is mediated by the AdipoR/JNK pathway, while the differentiation response is mediated via the AdipoR/p38 pathway. These findings suggest that osteoblasts are the direct targets of adiponectin.},

abstract = {Increased body weight is a strong risk factor for hypertension. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to estimate the effect of weight reduction on blood pressure overall and in population subgroups. Twenty-five randomized, controlled trials (comprising 34 strata) published between 1966 and 2002 with a total of 4874 participants were included. A random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity among trials. A net weight reduction of -5.1 kg (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -6.03 to -4.25) by means of energy restriction, increased physical activity, or both reduced systolic blood pressure by -4.44 mm Hg (95{\%} CI, -5.93 to -2.95) and diastolic blood pressure by -3.57 mm Hg (95{\%} CI, -4.88 to -2.25). Blood pressure reductions were -1.05 mm Hg (95{\%} CI, -1.43 to -0.66) systolic and -0.92 mm Hg (95{\%} CI, -1.28 to -0.55) diastolic when expressed per kilogram of weight loss. As expected, significantly larger blood pressure reductions were observed in populations with an average weight loss {\textgreater}5 kg than in populations with less weight loss, both for systolic (-6.63 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, -8.43 to -4.82] vs -2.70 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, -4.59 to -0.81]) and diastolic (-5.12 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, -6.48 to -3.75] vs -2.01 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, -3.47 to -0.54]) blood pressure. The effect on diastolic blood pressure was significantly larger in populations taking antihypertensive drugs than in untreated populations (-5.31 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, -6.64 to -3.99] vs -2.91 mm Hg [95{\%} CI, -3.66 to -2.16]). This meta-analysis clearly shows that weight loss is important for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The development of diabetic nephropathy is considered to be associated with oxidative stress. NADPH oxidase and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have attracted attention as mechanisms of generating oxidative stress. We studied the relation between the genotypes of the NADPH p22phox C242T and RAGE G1704T polymorphisms and the development of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using a retrospective review of clinical data, we allocated 181 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients to one of two groups: patients without diabetic nephropathy (group N; n = 108) and patients developing diabetic nephropathy (group D; n = 73) for 10 years or more. The p22phox C242T and RAGE G1704T polymorphisms were examined by Taqman PCR methods. RESULTS The frequency of the p22phox CC genotype was significantly higher in group D than in group N (90 vs. 79{\%}; P = 0.0427). The frequency of the RAGE GT + TT genotype was significantly higher in group D than in group N (26 vs. 13{\%}; P = 0.0313). The frequency of the combination of p22phox CC and RAGE GT + TT genotypes was significantly higher in group D than in group N (22 vs. 8{\%}; P = 0.0057). In multiple logistic regression analysis, systolic blood pressure, HbA(1c), triglycerides, and the combination of polymorphisms were shown to be independent variables. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that assessment of the combination of NADPH p22phox C242T and RAGE G1704T polymorphisms may be useful in identifying the risk for developing diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients.},

Genetic associates of BMI (FTO(rs9939609)) and circulating CRP (CRP(rs3091244)) have been used to reexamine observational associations between them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Observational analyses showed a strong, positive association between circulating CRP and BMI (change in BMI for a doubling in log CRP of 1.03 kg m(-2) (95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 1.00, 1.07), P{\textless}0.0001). Analysis using CRP(rs3091244) to re-estimate the causal effect of circulating CRP on BMI yielded null effects (change in BMI for a doubling in log CRP of -0.24 kg m(-2) (95{\%} CI: -0.58, 0.11), P=0.2). In contrast, analysis using FTO(rs9939609) to assess the causal effect of BMI on circulating CRP confirmed observational associations (ratio of geometric means of CRP per s.d. increase in BMI 1.41 (95{\%} CI: 1.10, 1.80), P=0.006).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that the observed association between circulating CRP and measured BMI is likely to be driven by BMI, with CRP being a marker of elevated adiposity.

abstract = {Because foods are consumed in combination, it is difficult in observational studies to separate the effects of single foods on the development of diseases. A possible way to examine the combined effect of food intakes is to derive dietary patterns by using appropriate statistical methods. The objective of this study was to apply a new statistical method, reduced rank regression (RRR), that is more flexible and powerful than the classic principal component analysis. RRR can be used efficiently in nutritional epidemiology by choosing disease-specific response variables and determining combinations of food intake that explain as much response variation as possible. The authors applied RRR to extract dietary patterns from 49 food groups, specifying four diabetes-related nutrients and nutrient ratios as responses. Data were derived from a nested German case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam study consisting of 193 cases with incident type 2 diabetes identified until 2001 and 385 controls. The four factors extracted by RRR explained 93.1{\%} of response variation, whereas the first four factors obtained by principal component analysis accounted for only 41.9{\%}. In contrast to principal component analysis and other methods, the new RRR method extracted a significant risk factor for diabetes.},

The energy intake from between-meal snacks correlated with SFA (standardized regression coefficient $\beta$ = 0.174, p = 0.002). The coefficient of alcohol intake was positive for VFA and negative for SFA, and alcohol intake correlated with the VFA/total fat area (TFA) ratio ($\beta$ = 0.130, p = 0.009). Alcohol intake was positively correlated with the blood non-esterified fatty acid concentration. Alcohol consumption additively increased energy intake from supper. The risk of an increase to VFA ≥ 100 cm(2) was 2.02 times higher (95{\%} CI: 1.15, 3.56) for subjects whose energy intake was ≥ 2200 kcal/d, and 2.07 times higher (95{\%} CI: 1.26, 3.42) in those who consumed ≥ 3 g/d alcohol.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Nutrient profiling is defined as the science of categorising foods based on their nutrient composition. The Choices Programme is a nutrient profile system with criteria that determine whether foods are eligible to carry a "healthier option" stamp. The Daily Menu Method which has been developed to evaluate these criteria is described here. This method simulates the change in calculated nutrient intakes which would be the result of consumers changing their diets in favour of food products that comply with the criteria.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Average intakes of energy, trans fatty acids (TFA), saturated fatty acids (SAFA), sodium, added sugar and fibre were derived from dietary intake studies and food consumption surveys of 7 countries: The Netherlands, Greece, Spain, the USA, Israel, China and South Africa. For each of the key nutrients, these average intakes were translated into three Typical Daily Menus per country. Average intakes based on these three menus were compared with average intakes from three Choices Daily Menus. To compose the Choices Menus, foods from the Typical Menus that did not comply with the Choices criteria were replaced with foods that did comply and are available on the market.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Comparison of intakes from the Choices Menus with the survey data showed that calculated intakes of energy, SAFA, TFA, sodium and added sugar were reduced. Fibre intakes were increased. The size of the effect differed per country.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The Daily Menu Method is a useful means to predict the potential effects of nutrient profiles such as the Choices criteria, on daily nutrient intakes. The method can be applied internationally and confirms that the criteria of the Choices Programme are in line with the aim of the programme: to improve nutrient intakes in the direction of the recommendations.},

Norms govern a wide range of phenomena, including property rights, contracts, bargains, forms of communication, and concepts of justice. Norms impose uniformity of behavior within a given social group, but often vary substantially among groups. Over time norm shifts may occur, prompted either by changes in objective circumstances or by subjective changes in perceptions and expectations. The dynamics of this process can be modeled using evolutionary game theory, which predicts that some norms are more stable than others in the long run.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a non-invasive technique for imaging the internal conductivity distribution in tissue within an MRI scanner, utilizing the magnetic flux density, which is introduced when a current is injected into the tissue from external electrodes. This magnetic flux alters the MRI signal, so that appropriate reconstruction can provide a map of the additional z-component of the magnetic field (B(z)) as well as the internal current density distribution that created it. To extract the internal electrical properties of the subject, including the conductivity and/or the current density distribution, MREIT techniques use the relationship between the external injection current and the z-component of the magnetic flux density B = (B(x), B(y), B(z)). The tissue studied typically contains defective regions, regions with a low MRI signal and/or low MRI signal-to-noise-ratio, due to the low density of nuclear magnetic resonance spins, short T(2) or T*(2) relaxation times, as well as regions with very low electrical conductivity, through which very little current traverses. These defective regions provide noisy B(z) data, which can severely degrade the overall reconstructed conductivity distribution. Injecting two independent currents through surface electrodes, this paper proposes a new direct method to reconstruct a regional absolute isotropic conductivity distribution in a region of interest (ROI) while avoiding the defective regions. First, the proposed method reconstructs the contrast of conductivity using the transversal J-substitution algorithm, which blocks the propagation of severe accumulated noise from the defective region to the ROI. Second, the proposed method reconstructs the regional projected current density using the relationships between the internal current density, which stems from a current injection on the surface, and the measured B(z) data. Combining the contrast conductivity distribution in the entire imaging slice and the reconstructed regional projected current density, we propose a direct non-iterative algorithm to reconstruct the absolute conductivity in the ROI. The numerical simulations in the presence of various degrees of noise, as well as a phantom MRI imaging experiment showed that the proposed method reconstructs the regional absolute conductivity in a ROI within a subject including the defective regions. In the simulation experiment, the relative L₂-mode errors of the reconstructed regional and global conductivities were 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, using a noise level of 50 db in the defective region.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. The authors proposed an electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method to measure the distribution of muscle activity in the forearm using surface EMG signals from multiple surface electrodes. The present study is to develop a method to estimate muscle stress, i.e., force generated during contraction per unit area in the whole cross-section of the forearm based on EMG-CT. While three subjects performed hand gripping trials using three hand grip devices, EMG signals around the forearm were measured using EMG-CT. An EMG conduction model of the forearm was constructed using an outline geometry of the subjects' forearm which was measured with a handy 3D scanner. The stress of muscle was calculated from the relationship between gripping force and total muscle activity. As a result, the distribution of muscle stress in the forearm during hand gripping was visualized in a tomographic image. It was clear that the stress was concentrated in the flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor carpi radialis, and extensor digitorum communis region. The maximum stress in the forearm muscles increased from 0.08 ± 0.01 to 0.18 ± 0.02 MPa when gripping force increased from 77 to 242 N. This study provides a novel method of measuring muscle stress in forearm.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this clinical trial was to examine the efficacy of a supplement containing natural S-(-)equol, a daidzein metabolite, in reducing menopausal symptoms. Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 160 equol nonproducing, postmenopausal Japanese women who experienced at least 1 hot flush/day were randomly assigned to consume 10mg/day S-(-)equol (n=77 women) or placebo (n=83 women) for 12 weeks. Participants completed a standardized menopausal symptom checklist and rated five common menopause symptoms by a visual analog scale at baseline, week 12, and week 18 (6-week postintervention). Physical, blood, and urine examinations were conducted. One hundred twenty-six women completed the study. Results: At baseline, daily hot flush frequency was 2.9(plus or minus)2.1 for the S-(-)equol group and 3.2(plus or minus)2.4 for the placebo group. After the 12-week intervention, the S-(-)equol group had a greater decrease from baseline in hot flush frequency compared with the placebo group (-1.9(plus or minus)1.8/day, -58.7{\%}, vs. -1.0(plus or minus)2.0/day, -34.5{\%}, p=0.009). The severity of hot flushes and neck or shoulder muscle stiffness significantly decreased in the S-(-)equol group compared with the placebo group. No changes in clinical parameters or serious adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: This is the first trial to show beneficial effects of a 10-mg natural S-(-)equol supplement consumed daily for 12 weeks on major menopausal symptoms, specifically, hot flushes and neck or shoulder muscle stiffness, in postmenopausal Japanese women. This supplement offers a promising alternative for management of menopausal symptoms. (copyright) Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.},

abstract = {Osteoporosis is one of chief complications of anorexia nervosa. Their calcium intake decreases and 84{\%}are lack of vitamin D. The abnormal bone metabolism in severely emaciated patients with anorexia nervosa involves both a reduction in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption. The annual change in lumbar bone mineral density(BMD)is significantly correlated with body mass index(BMI)at the entry. The critical BMI for a positive increase in BMD was 16.4±0.3 kg/m2. Since 30{\%}of patients are lack of vitamin K, their bone quality deteriorates. The risk factors of a decrease in lumbar vertebrae BMD is a duration of emaciation when both serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-Ⅰ as a potent osteogenic factor and estradiol as a powerful bone resorption inhibitor decrease. Therefore, the prevention and the treatment are weight gain. However, the patient does not accept weight gain easily. Active form vitamin D3 of 0.5$\mu$g/day or 30-45 mg/day of vitamin K2 preparation prevents the further decrease in bone mineral density. Eldecalcitol of 0.5$\mu$g/day shows about 5{\%}increase in lumbar vertebrae BMD in first year. Bisphosphonate and a RANK ligand inhibitors, denosumab should not be used for young patients and women in hope of the pregnancy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study investigated the relationship between frequency of skipping breakfast and annual changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). METHODS The participants were 4,430 factory employees. BMI and WC were measured repeatedly at annual medical examinations over a 5-year period. The association between frequency of skipping breakfast at the baseline examination and annual changes in anthropometric indices was evaluated using the generalized estimating equation method. RESULTS The mean (standard deviation) BMI was 23.3 (3.0) kg m-2 for men and 21.9 (3.6) kg m-2 for women; and the mean WC was 82.6 (8.7) cm for men and 77.8 (9.8) cm for women. During the follow-up period, mean BMI increased by 0.2 kg m-2 for men and women, and mean WC increased by 1.1 cm for men and 1.0 cm for women. The annual change in the BMI of men who skipped breakfast four to six times per week was 0.061 kg m-2 higher, and that of those who skipped breakfast seven times per week was 0.046 kg m-2 higher, compared with those who did not skip breakfast. Annual changes in the WC of male participants who skipped breakfast seven times per week was 0.248 cm higher than that of those who did not skip breakfast. Skipping breakfast was not associated with changes in BMI or WC in women. CONCLUSIONS Skipping breakfast was closely associated with annual changes in BMI and WC among men, and eating breakfast more than four times per week may prevent the excessive body weight gain associated with skipping breakfast.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s). Purpose: The nutritional changes that have accompanied the modernization of Japanese dietary patterns have led to significant increases in the number of people who are overweight or obese. This study aimed to clarify the effects of these nutritional changes on postprandial energy expenditure and the release of metabolism-regulating hormones. Methods: The total daily energy content (20 {\%} breakfast, 40 {\%} lunch, and 40 {\%} dinner) and macronutrient composition (carbohydrate/fat/protein) was 8807.3 kJ and 364.3:30.1:66.4 (g) for the traditional test diet and 9217.6 kJ and 331.7:66.1:76.9 (g) for the modern test diet. In experiment 1, nine healthy Japanese men participated in a crossover study during which they ingested a test diet comprising three meals; postprandial blood parameters were measured after each meal. In experiment 2, another ten men participated in a crossover study during which they ingested 2 meals, after which metabolic responses and blood variables were evaluated. Results: The modern diet induced greater blood levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and ghrelin than did the traditional diet. The expected increase in postprandial energy expenditure (∆REE) tended to be dampened after the modern compared with the traditional diet. GIP was inversely correlated with ∆REE after lunch, and ghrelin was positively associated with ∆REE. Conclusion: Both GIP and ghrelin are robust indicators of postprandial energy expenditure. The nutritional changes accompanying the modernization of Japanese dietary patterns may increase the levels of the anabolic intestinal hormone GIP, which is associated with ∆REE, in the Japanese population. The contribution of an increased ghrelin concentration to the decreased ∆REE after the modern diet warrants further investigation.},

The method explicitly accounts for the heterogeneity of studies through a statistical parameter representing the inter-study variation. We discuss several iterative and non-iterative alternative methods for estimating the inter-study variance and hence the overall population treatment effect. We show that the leading methods for estimating the inter-study variance are special cases of a general method-of-moments estimate of the inter-study variance. The general method suggests two new two-step methods. The iterative estimate is statistically optimal and it can be easily calculated on a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, available on the desktop of most researchers. The two-step methods approximate the optimal iterative method better than the earlier one-step non-iterative methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD) was identified in Miyazaki prefecture in March 2000, Japan conducted an intensive serological and clinical survey in the areas surrounding the index herd. As a result of the survey during the 21 days of the movement-restriction period, two infected herds were detected and destroyed; there were no other cases in the months that followed. To evaluate the survey used for screening the disease-control area and surveillance area, we estimated the herd-level sensitivity of the survey (HSe) through a spreadsheet model using Monte-Carlo methods. The Reed-Frost model was incorporated to simulate the spread of FMD within an infected herd. In the simulations, 4, 8 and 12 effective-contact scenarios during the 5-day period were examined. The estimated HSes of serological tests (HSeE) were 71.0, 75.3 and 76.3{\%} under the 4, 8 and 12 contact scenarios, respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the number of contacts beyond 12 did not improve HSeE, but increasing the number of sampled animals and delaying the dates of sampling did raise HSeES. Small herd size in the outbreak area ({\textgreater}80{\%} of herds have {\textless}20 animals) seems to have helped in maintaining HSeE relatively high, although the serological inspection was carried out before sero-positive animals had a chance to increase in infected herds. The estimated herd-level specificity of serological tests (HSpE) was 98.6{\%}. This HSpE predicted 224 false-positive herds (5th percentile estimate was 200 and 95th percentile was 249), which proved close to the 232 false-positive herds actually observed. The combined-test herd-level sensitivity (serological and clinical inspections combined; CTHSe), averaged 85.5, 87.6 and 88.1{\%} for the 4, 8 and 12 contact scenarios, respectively. Using these CTHSes, the calculated probability that no infected herd was overlooked by the survey was ≥62.5{\%} under the most-conservative, four-contact scenario. The probability that no more than one infected herd was overlooked was ≥89.7{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is assuming a prominent role as a risk factor because of the double metabolic burden derived from low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and excess adiposity (obesity). The increase in obesity prevalence rates in older subjects is of concern given the associated disease risks and more limited therapeutic options available in this age group. This review has two main objectives. The primary objective is to collate results from studies investigating the effects of SO on physical and cardio-metabolic functions. The secondary objective is to evaluate published studies for consistency in methodology, diagnostic criteria, exposure and outcome selection. Large between-study heterogeneity was observed in the application of diagnostic criteria and choice of body composition components for the assessment of SO, which contributes to the inconsistent associations of SO with cardio-metabolic outcomes. We propose a metabolic load:capacity model of SO given by the ratio between fat mass and fat free mass, and discuss how this could be operationalised. The concept of regional fat distribution could be incorporated into the model and tested in future studies to advance our understanding of SO as a predictor of risk for cardio-metabolic diseases and physical disability.},

abstract = {The neural basis of memory subprocesses, encoding and retrieval, have been extensively examined in functional neuroimaging studies. However, the cortical substrates of taste memory, which form an important part of our episodic memory, have rarely been explored in humans. Previously, we have used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and found activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) related to taste encoding. The method used in the current study allowed brain monitoring while participants tasted liquid taste-stimuli in upright positions. Here, using the same system, we examined the LPFC activity of 28 healthy volunteers during both the encoding and the retrieval of taste memory. The contrast between the retrieval and eyes-closed-resting conditions revealed activation in the bilateral LPFC. This activation was significantly larger than that for encoding in the bilateral frontopolar and right dorso-LPFC regions, particularly in the right hemisphere (N=28, P {\textless} 0.05, FDR corrected), exhibiting right hemispheric dominance. Our findings are in line with the hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry (HERA) model, which proposes a process-specific prefrontal contribution to memory function. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

HYBID mRNA is highly expressed in the brain, however, the role of HYBID in the brain remains unclear. In this study, we bred Hybid knock-out (KO) mice and evaluated the function of Hybid in the central nervous system. Hybid mRNA was expressed in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and cerebellum, in wild-type mice. Hybid KO mice demonstrated decreased mnemonic ability in novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. The average molecular mass of hippocampal HA increased in KO mice, accompanied by a significant increase in the total HA amount. Hybid KO mice did not differ in behavior from wild-type mice in the open field test, evaluation of acoustic startle responses, or drug-induced seizure test. In real-time PCR, Hyal1 and Hyal2 mRNA levels, which code hyaluronidases 1 and 2, respectively, did not differ between the Hybid KO and wild-type mouse brain. These results indicate that Hybid plays a key role in memory function in the brain.},

@article{Duncan_1995_8564797,
abstract = {Mechanotransduction plays a crucial role in the physiology of many tissues including bone. Mechanical loading can inhibit bone resorption and increase bone formation in vivo. In bone, the process of mechanotransduction can be divided into four distinct steps: (1) mechanocoupling, (2) biochemical coupling, (3) transmission of signal, and (4) effector cell response. In mechanocoupling, mechanical loads in vivo cause deformations in bone that stretch bone cells within and lining the bone matrix and create fluid movement within the canaliculae of bone. Dynamic loading, which is associated with extracellular fluid flow and the creation of streaming potentials within bone, is most effective for stimulating new bone formation in vivo. Bone cells in vitro are stimulated to produce second messengers when exposed to fluid flow or mechanical stretch. In biochemical coupling, the possible mechanisms for the coupling of cell-level mechanical signals into intracellular biochemical signals include force transduction through the integrin-cytoskeleton-nuclear matrix structure, stretch-activated cation channels within the cell membrane, G protein-dependent pathways, and linkage between the cytoskeleton and the phospholipase C or phospholipase A pathways. The tight interaction of each of these pathways would suggest that the entire cell is a mechanosensor and there are many different pathways available for the transduction of a mechanical signal. In the transmission of signal, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and bone lining cells may act as sensors of mechanical signals and may communicate the signal through cell processes connected by gap junctions. These cells also produce paracrine factors that may signal osteoprogenitors to differentiate into osteoblasts and attach to the bone surface. Insulin-like growth factors and prostaglandins are possible candidates for intermediaries in signal transduction. In the effector cell response, the effects of mechanical loading are dependent upon the magnitude, duration, and rate of the applied load. Longer duration, lower amplitude loading has the same effect on bone formation as loads with short duration and high amplitude. Loading must be cyclic to stimulate new bone formation. Aging greatly reduces the osteogenic effects of mechanical loading in vivo. Also, some hormones may interact with local mechanical signals to change the sensitivity of the sensor or effector cells to mechanical load.},

abstract = {Behavioral and perceptual responses to food depend on a convergence between gustatory, olfactory, and visual information. In previous studies a secondary cortical taste area has been found in the caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex of the primate. Furthermore, neurons with olfactory responses have been recorded in a more medial part of the orbitofrontal cortex, and visual inputs have been shown to influence neurons in an intermediate region. These studies suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex may act as a region for convergence of multiple sensory modalities including chemosensation. In the present study neurons throughout the caudal two-thirds of the orbitofrontal cortex of the macaque were tested to gustatory, to olfactory, and to visual stimulation to investigate whether convergence occurs. Neurons in this region of cortex were found that responded to stimulation of the taste, olfactory, or visual system. In addition, some neurons were found with bimodal responses, responding for example to both taste and olfactory, or taste and visual stimuli. Since these multimodal neurons were found in very close proximity to unimodal neurons, and the unimodal sensory neurons were intermingled, it is possible that the orbitofrontal cortex represents the first cortical area of convergence for these three modalities in primates.},

Cinnamate derivatives which would not release cinnamic acid by hydro-lysis are excluded. The quantitative data are reviewed concisely and attention is drawn to certain shortcomings, in particular a complete absence of data for certain commodities (breakfast cereals, baked goods, tomato products and nuts) and minimal data for pulses, legumes and processed or cooked foods. In addition, more data are required for the edible portion of modern varieties. By extrapolating from such data as are available the important source(s) (i) of individual cinnamates (regardless of the conjugate type) and (ii) of each major class of conjugate, have been identi{\"{u}}ed as follows : (i) Cinnamates : caþ eic acid : coþ ee beverage, blueberries, apples, ciders ; p-coumaric acid : spinach, sugar beet {\"{u}}bre, cereal brans ; ferulic acid : coþ ee beverage, citrus juices, sugar beet {\"{u}}bre, cereal brans ; sinapic acid : broccoli, kale, other leafy brassicas, citrus juices. (ii) Conjugates : caþ eoylquinic acids : coþ ee beverage, blueberries, apples, ciders ; p-coumaroylquinic acids : sweet cherries ; feruloylquinic acids : coþ ee beverage ; tartaric conju-gates : spinach, lettuce, grapes and wines ; malic conjugates : lettuce, spinach, possibly legumes ; rosmarinic acid : culinary herbs, mixed herbs, possibly stuffings ; cell wall conjugates : spinach, sugar beet {\"{u}}bre, cereal brans. It seems likely that the UK population will fall into several categories depending on (i) their consump-tion of coþ ee, (ii) their consumption of bran, and (iii) their consumption of citrus. Those who drink several cups of coþ ee per day augmented by bran and citrus might easily ingest 500–800 mg cin-namates (or even 1 g for the greatest coþ ee ingest consumption) whereas those who eschew all these and take little fresh fruit or vegetables might struggle to consume 25 mg.},

The subjects consumed 185 g of a test beverage with or without CPP (359mg) daily for 1 week. Energy metabolism was evaluated by in- direct calorimetry before and after the test period af- ter fasting and up to3.5hr postprandially, and during cycle ergometry. Indirect calorimetry showed that, compared to 1-week ingestionof the control beverage, 1-week ingestion of the CPPbeverage led to signif- icantly higher oxygen consumption in the sedentary period and during the cycle ergometry. CPP bever- age consumption led to a higher fat utilization in the sedentary period and a higher anaerobic threshold during exercise compared with control beverage con- sumption. In conclusion, daily consumption of CPP increases postprandial fat utilization in healthy hu- mans. Key},

It has been argued that such a reduction may not be limited to food liking but extends to food wanting as well. Animal research suggests that sensory-specific satiety reflects a reduction in both food liking and food wanting and in the present study it was investigated whether this also holds true for humans. Participants had to consume a certain amount of chocolate milk and afterwards approximately half of the participants played a game to obtain more chocolate milk, whereas the other half played a game to obtain crisps. Participants showed a decline in subjective liking of taste and smell of the chocolate milk in comparison to crisps. Furthermore, they showed less motivation (i.e. wanting) to obtain more chocolate milk. It is concluded that sensory-specific satiety in humans reflects a decrease in both food liking and food wanting. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The more commonly known statistical procedures, such as the t-test, analysis of variance, or chi-squared test, can handle only one dependent variable (DV) at a time. Two types of problems can arise when there is more than one DV: 1. a greater probability of erroneously concluding that there is a significant difference between the groups when in fact there is none (a Type I error); and 2. failure to detect differences between the groups in terms of the patterns of DVs (a Type II error). Multivariate statistics are designed to overcome both of these problems. However, there are costs associated with these benefits, such as increased complexity, decreased power, multiple ways of answering the same question, and ambiguity in the allocation of shared variance. This is the first of a series of articles on multivariate statistical tests which will address these issues and explain their possible uses.},

abstract = {An in vitro study was conducted to investigate the effect of different concentrations of Euglena (Euglena gracilis) on CH4production, dry matter (DM) digestibility, volatile fatty acid (VFA) and ammonia N(NH3-N) concentration as well as on the protozoa population. The treatments considered were Euglena at concentrations of 0.0, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 1000g/kg dry matter (DM) of the substrate (60:40 forage: concentrate ratio) incubated for 24 and 96h using an in vitro continuous gas production and in vitro two-stage digestion procedure, respectively. The data were subjected to polynomial regression analysis. Methane emissions (ml/g DM) decreased at an increasing rate, generally with increasing concentration of Euglena but also exhibited quadratic (P{\textless}0.001) and cubic (P{\textless}0.001) effects while NH3-N (mg/ml) concentration increased at an increasing rate (linear P{\textless}0.001; quadratic P=0.001; cubic P=0.024). Total VFA concentration (mmol/l) decreased significantly (P{\textless}0.001), when the substrate was totally replaced by Euglena. There was a linear (P{\textless}0.001) and cubic (P=0.047) reduction in protozoa population as the concentration of Euglena increased. In vitro DM digestibility was improved (linear P=0.003; quadratic P=0.04; cubic P{\textless}0.001). These findings demonstrate that Euglena at concentration of 100g/kg DM reduce CH4emissions by 9.1{\%} and improve DM digestibility by 14.3{\%}. However, when the concentration of Euglena increases from 100g/kg DM, while further reducing CH4emissions, have negative effect on NH3-N concentration, protozoa population and VFA concentration.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Popular diets, particularly those low in carbohydrates, have challenged current recommendations advising a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for weight loss. Potential benefits and risks have not been tested adequately. OBJECTIVE To compare 4 weight-loss diets representing a spectrum of low to high carbohydrate intake for effects on weight loss and related metabolic variables. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twelve-month randomized trial conducted in the United States from February 2003 to October 2005 among 311 free-living, overweight/obese (body mass index, 27-40) nondiabetic, premenopausal women. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to follow the Atkins (n = 77), Zone (n = 79), LEARN (n = 79), or Ornish (n = 76) diets and received weekly instruction for 2 months, then an additional 10-month follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Weight loss at 12 months was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), percentage of body fat, waist-hip ratio, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and blood pressure. Outcomes were assessed at months 0, 2, 6, and 12. The Tukey studentized range test was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS Weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups at 12 months, and mean 12-month weight loss was significantly different between the Atkins and Zone diets (P{\textless}.05). Mean 12-month weight loss was as follows: Atkins, -4.7 kg (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -6.3 to -3.1 kg), Zone, -1.6 kg (95{\%} CI, -2.8 to -0.4 kg), LEARN, -2.6 kg (-3.8 to -1.3 kg), and Ornish, -2.2 kg (-3.6 to -0.8 kg). Weight loss was not statistically different among the Zone, LEARN, and Ornish groups. At 12 months, secondary outcomes for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups. CONCLUSIONS In this study, premenopausal overweight and obese women assigned to follow the Atkins diet, which had the lowest carbohydrate intake, lost more weight at 12 months than women assigned to follow the Zone diet, and had experienced comparable or more favorable metabolic effects than those assigned to the Zone, Ornish, or LEARN diets [corrected] While questions remain about long-term effects and mechanisms, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible alternative recommendation for weight loss.

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a safe medical imaging technology, requiring no ionizing or heating radiation, as opposed to most other imaging modalities. This has led to a clinical interest in its use for long-term monitoring, possibly at the bedside, for ventilation monitoring, bleeding detection, gastric emptying and epilepsy foci diagnosis. These long-term applications demand auto-calibration and high stability over long time periods. To address this need we have developed a new multi-frequency EIT system called the KHU Mark2.5 with automatic self-calibration and cooperation with other devices via a timing signal for synchronization with other medical instruments. The impedance measurement module (IMM) for flexible configuration as a key component includes an independent constant current source, an independent differential voltmeter, and a current source calibrator, which allows automatic self-calibration of the current source within each IMM. We installed a resistor phantom inside the KHU Mark2.5 EIT system for intra-channel and inter-channel calibrations of all voltmeters in multiple IMMs. We show the deterioration of performance of an EIT system over time and the improvement due to automatic self-calibration. The system is able to maintain SNR of 80 dB for frequencies up to 250 kHz and below 0.5{\%} reciprocity error over continuous operation for 24 hours. Automatic calibration at least every 3 days is shown to maintain SNR above 75 dB and reciprocity error below 0.7{\%} over 7 days at 1 kHz. A clear degradation in performance results with increasing time between automatic calibrations allowing the tailoring of calibration to suit the performance requirements of each application.},

abstract = {A pattern-recognition method, making use of Fourier transformations to extract features which are significant for a pattern, is described. The ordinary Fourier coefficients are difficult to use as input to categorizers because they contain factors dependent upon size and rotation as well as an arbitrary phase angle. From these Fourier coefficients, however, other more useful features can easily be derived. By using these derived property constants, a distinction can be made between genuine shape constants and constants representing size, location, and orientation. The usefulness of the method has been tested with a computer program that was used to classify 175 samples of handprinted letters, e.g., 7 sets of the 25 letters A to Z. In this test, 98 percent were correctly recognized when a simple nonoptimized decision method was used.

Participants were randomly assigned into the placebo (P, n 11) or green tea (GT, n 11) group. The GT group consumed a catechin-rich green tea (catechins 615 mg/350 ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. The P group consumed a placebo (catechins 92 mg/350 ml) beverage per d for 4 weeks. At baseline and after 4 weeks, participants of each group consumed their designated beverages with breakfast and consumed lunch 3 h after breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0 h) and at 2, 4 and 6 h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose concentrations were 3 {\%} lower in the GT group than in the P group (three-factor ANOVA, group × time interaction, P{\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05). Serum concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites increased after meals (P{\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05), but no effect of catechin-rich green tea intake was observed.

The robust population stability of this trait is called canalization. It has been represented by a hyperbolic function of two variables: insulin sensitivity and insulin response. Environmental changes due to global migration may have pushed some human subpopulations to different points of stability. We hypothesized that there may be ethnic differences in the optimal states in the relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin response.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified studies that measured the insulin sensitivity index (SI) and acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) in three major ethnic groups: Africans, Caucasians, and East Asians. We identified 74 study cohorts comprising 3,813 individuals (19 African cohorts, 31 Caucasian, and 24 East Asian). We calculated the hyperbolic relationship using the mean values of SI and AIRg in the healthy cohorts with normal glucose tolerance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that Caucasian subpopulations were located around the middle point of the hyperbola, while African and East Asian subpopulations are located around unstable extreme points, where a small change in one variable is associated with a large nonlinear change in the other variable.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the genetic background of Africans and East Asians makes them more and differentially susceptible to diabetes than Caucasians. This ethnic stratification could be implicated in the different natural courses of diabetes onset.},

abstract = {Abstract The objective of the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software project is to develop freely available software that can be used to reconstruct electrical or optical material properties from boundary measurements. Nonlinear and ill posed problems such as electrical impedance and optical tomography are typically approached using a finite element model for the forward calculations and a regularized nonlinear solver for obtaining a unique and stable inverse solution. Most of the commercially available finite element programs are unsuitable for solving these problems because of their conventional inefficient way of calculating the Jacobian, and their lack of accurate electrode modelling. A complete package for the two-dimensional EIT problem was officially released by Vauhkonen et al at the second half of 2000. However most industrial and medical electrical imaging problems are fundamentally three-dimensional. To assist the development we have developed and released a free toolkit of Matlab routines which can be employed to solve the forward and inverse EIT problems in three dimensions based on the complete electrode model along with some basic visualization utilities, in the hope that it will stimulate further development. We also include a derivation of the formula for the Jacobian (or sensitivity) matrix based on the complete electrode model.},

abstract = {Taste is unique among sensory systems in its innate association with mechanisms of reward and aversion in addition to its recognition of quality, e.g., sucrose is sweet and preferable, and quinine is bitter and aversive. Taste information is sent to the reward system and feeding center via the prefrontal cortices such as the mediodorsal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices in rodents and the orbitofrontal cortex in primates. The amygdala, which receives taste inputs, also influences reward and feeding. In terms of neuroactive substances, palatability is closely related to benzodiazepine derivatives and beta-endorphin, both of which facilitate consumption of food and fluid. The reward system contains the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum and finally sends information to the lateral hypothalamic area, the feeding center. The dopaminergic system originating from the ventral tegmental area mediates the motivation to consume palatable food. The actual ingestive behavior is promoted by the orexigenic neuropeptides from the hypothalamus. Even palatable food can become aversive and avoided as a consequence of a postingestional unpleasant experience such as malaise. The neural mechanisms of this conditioned taste aversion will also be elucidated.},

The present study was conducted to examine the effects of DAG oil on carcinogenesis in c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene transgenic (Tg) rats administered 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO, 10 ppm) in their drinking water for 10 weeks for initiation of mainly upper digestive organs.

The study was terminated at week 12 (Tg females) and 20 (Tg males, wild females and males). The fatty acid composition of DAG oil was similar to TAG (linoleic acid 46.6{\%} and oleic acid 38.9{\%}). In Tg male rats, DAG oil administration was associated with significant increase (P {\textless} 0.05) in the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the tongue (5.5{\%} DAG, 43.8{\%}; 2.75{\%} DAG, 20{\%}; 1.38{\%} DAG, 14.3{\%}; 0{\%}, 12.3{\%}) with the Cochran-Armitage trend test and also number of tumors in coefficients for linear contrast trend tests.

The results suggest that a combined dendritic and cyclic structural network pattern is associated with low to moderate HIV propagation in Colorado Springs, and may account for the absence of intense propagation of the virus.},

abstract = {The present work is focused on the determination of in vivo doses and studies of genetic effects in workers exposed to epichlorohydrin (ECH). The studied endpoints were hemoglobin (Hb) adducts, frequencies of hprt mutants, micronuclei in cytochalasin B blocked binucleated lymphocytes, sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and high frequency cells (HFC). Blood samples were collected from office clerks and ECH exposed factory workers at an industrial plant in Germany. The workers were exposed to 0.11-0.23 ppm ECH in the air 45 h per week and to 0.2-2.6 ppm for 3 h per week. Some Swedish non-exposed subjects were also used for Hb adduct measurements. The genetic data. HFC and SCE, showed a significant difference between exposed and unexposed donors. In contrast to earlier studies on SCE, no impact of smoking was observed. Effects on micronuclei were on the borderline of significance, whereas there was no effect for HPRT mutants. The average Hb adduct level was higher in exposed than in non-exposed donors, although the difference was only significant when the exposed group was compared to Swedish controls. Smoking gave significantly increased adduct levels. The absence of significant correlations between individual data for Hb adducts and genetic effects, may be explained by the different periods of time coveted by the responses n these endpoints. Whereas Hb adducts reflect the exposure during up to 4 months (i.e. the life span of human erythrocytes), the SCE and particularly the HFC seem to accumulate for years in a long-lived fraction of T- lymphocytes without DNA repair. Thus, the adduct data does not reflect the exposure backwards, in time unless it can be shown that exposure conditions have remained unchanged. The origin of the background adduct levels in non- smoking control persons is at present not known.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Japan has entered the era of super-ageing and advanced health transition, which is increasingly putting pressure on the sustainability of its health system. The level and pace of this health transition might vary across regions within Japan and concern is growing about increasing regional variations in disease burden. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive, comparable framework. We used data from GBD 2015 with the aim to quantify the burden of disease and injuries, and to attribute risk factors in Japan at a subnational, prefecture-level. METHODS We used data from GBD 2015 for 315 causes and 79 risk factors of death, disease, and injury incidence and prevalence to measure the burden of diseases and injuries in Japan and in the 47 Japanese prefectures from 1990 to 2015. We extracted data from GBD 2015 to assess mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy (HALE) in Japan and its 47 prefectures. We split extracted data by prefecture and applied GBD methods to generate estimates of burden, and attributable burden due to known risk factors. We examined the prefecture-level relationships of common health system inputs (eg, health expenditure and workforces) to the GBD outputs in 2015 to address underlying determinants of regional health variations. FINDINGS Life expectancy at birth in Japan increased by 4{\textperiodcentered}2 years from 79{\textperiodcentered}0 years (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 79{\textperiodcentered}0 to 79{\textperiodcentered}0) to 83{\textperiodcentered}2 years (83{\textperiodcentered}1 to 83{\textperiodcentered}2) between 1990 and 2015. However, the gaps between prefectures with the lowest and highest life expectancies and HALE have widened, from 2{\textperiodcentered}5 to 3{\textperiodcentered}1 years and from 2{\textperiodcentered}3 to 2{\textperiodcentered}7 years, respectively, from 1990 to 2015. Although overall age-standardised death rates decreased by 29{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (28{\textperiodcentered}7 to 29{\textperiodcentered}3) from 1990 to 2015, the rates of mortality decline in this period substantially varied across the prefectures, ranging from -32{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (-34{\textperiodcentered}8 to -30{\textperiodcentered}0) to -22{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (-20{\textperiodcentered}4 to -20{\textperiodcentered}1). During the same time period, the rate of age-standardised DALYs was reduced overall by 19{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}9 to 22{\textperiodcentered}0). The reduction in rates of age-standardised YLDs was very small by 3{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}6 to 4{\textperiodcentered}3). The pace of reduction in mortality and DALYs in many leading causes has largely levelled off since 2005. Known risk factors accounted for 34{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (32{\textperiodcentered}4 to 36{\textperiodcentered}9) of DALYs; the two leading behavioural risk factors were unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking in 2015. The common health system inputs were not associated with age-standardised death and DALY rates in 2015. INTERPRETATION Japan has been successful overall in reducing mortality and disability from most major diseases. However, progress has slowed down and health variations between prefectures is growing. In view of the limited association between the prefecture-level health system inputs and health outcomes, the potential sources of regional variations, including subnational health system performance, urgently need assessment.

Besides poor glycemic control itself, some glucose-lowering agents are also associated with increased fracture risk. Thiazolidinediones increase fracture risk probably through inhibition of bone formation as well as increased resorption leading to decreased BMD. Sodium-glucose cotransporter(SGLT)-2 inhibitors have been reported to decrease BMD and increase fracture risk. However, the class effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on bone metabolism remains to be established. In diabetic patients, especially in those with high fracture risk such as postmenopausal women, careful selection of glucose-lowering agents as well as appropriate and timely intervention for osteoporosis is necessary.},

The choice of tuning parameters can be viewed as a model selection and evaluation problem. Mallows' Cp type criteria may be used as a tuning parameter selection tool in lasso type regularization methods, for which the concept of degrees of freedom plays a key role. In the present paper, we propose an efficient algorithm that computes the degrees of freedom by extending the generalized path seeking algorithm. Our procedure allows us to construct model selection criteria for evaluating models estimated by regularization with a wide variety of convex and nonconvex penalties. The proposed methodology is investigated through the analysis of real data and Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results show that Cp criterion based on our algorithm performs well in various situations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Despite the high prevalence of obesity, eating disorders, and weight-related health problems in modernized cultures, the neural systems regulating human feeding remain poorly understood. Therefore, we applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the cerebral responses of 13 healthy normal-weight adult women as they viewed color photographs of food. The motivational salience of the stimuli was manipulated by presenting images from three categories: high-calorie foods, low-calorie foods, and nonedible dining-related utensils. Both food categories were associated with bilateral activation of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. High-calorie foods yielded significant activation within the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. Low-calorie foods yielded smaller regions of focal activation within medial orbitofrontal cortex; primary gustatory/somatosensory cortex; and superior, middle, and medial temporal regions. Findings suggest that the amygdala may be responsive to a general category of biologically relevant stimuli such as food, whereas separate ventromedial prefrontal systems may be activated depending on the perceived reward value or motivational salience of food stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and $\beta$3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) genes play central roles in the thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans. However, the importance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both genes during the development of obesity is controversial. Although active BAT in adult humans is frequently observed in the winter season, the effects of sampling season have not been taken into consideration in previous association studies. Here, we tested the associations of UCP1 -3826A/G and ADRB3 Trp64Arg with body mass index (BMI) and visceral fat area (VFA) in 3013 Japanese adults sampled during different seasons. Association between SNPs and the obesity-related traits were assessed using multiple linear regression models, including sex, age, physical activity, and genotypes. Both SNPs did not show significant associations in the models based on the entire cohort. However, in subsets comprising individuals mainly sampled from winter to spring, UCP1 showed significant associations with VFA (P = 0.0098) and VFA adjusted for BMI (P = 0.0128). Moreover, the effects of UCP1 on VFA were strongly negatively correlated with outdoor temperature (P = 0.00011), but not with night length (P = 0.039). ADRB3 did not show these associations, but an additive effect with UCP1 was observed for VFA adjusted for BMI (P = 0.0067). Subsets sampled in the hot season did not show significant associations for both SNPs. The season-specific effects of UCP1 on VFA were consistent with a previous finding that active BAT was more frequently found in winter than in summer, and supported the importance of cold stress in BAT activation and the significance of BAT in the development of obesity in adult humans.},

abstract = {Interpretation and estimation of vaccine efficacy is complicated when the vaccine effect is heterogeneous across vaccinated strata. If a person has a certain susceptibility, or probability of becoming infected conditional on a specified exposure to infection, then one effect of a vaccine would be to reduce that susceptibility, possibly to zero. Vaccine efficacy is a function of the relative susceptibilities in the vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Under heterogeneity of vaccine effect, a general expression for a summary vaccine efficacy parameter is a function of the vaccine efficacy in the different vaccinated strata weighted by the fraction of the vaccinated subpopulations in each stratum. Interpretation and estimability of the summary vaccine efficacy parameter depends on whether the strata are identifiable, and whether the heterogeneity is host- or vaccine-related. Bounds are derived for the summary vaccine efficacy when the strata are not identifiable for the case of an outbreak of an acute infectious disease. The upper bound assumes that everyone is equally affected by the vaccine, and the lower bound assumes that some are completely protected while others have no protection. The biologic interpretation of the two bounds is different.},

abstract = {Complementary neurophysiological recordings in macaques and functional neuroimaging in humans show that the primary taste cortex in the rostral insula and adjoining frontal operculum provides separate and combined representations of the taste, temperature, and texture (including viscosity and fat texture) of food in the mouth independently of hunger and thus of reward value and pleasantness. One synapse on, in the orbitofrontal cortex, these sensory inputs are for some neurons combined by learning with olfactory and visual inputs. Different neurons respond to different combinations, providing a rich representation of the sensory properties of food. In the orbitofrontal cortex, feeding to satiety with one food decreases the responses of these neurons to that food, but not to other foods, showing that sensory-specific satiety is computed in the primate (including human) orbitofrontal cortex. Consistently, activation of parts of the human orbitofrontal cortex correlates with subjective ratings of the pleasantness of the taste and smell of food. Cognitive factors, such as a word label presented with an odour, influence the pleasantness of the odour, and the activation produced by the odour in the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings provide a basis for understanding how what is in the mouth is represented by independent information channels in the brain; how the information from these channels is combined; and how and where the reward and subjective affective value of food is represented and is influenced by satiety signals. Activation of these representations in the orbitofrontal cortex may provide the goal for eating, and understanding them helps to provide a basis for understanding appetite and its disorders. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Sensory-specific satiety (SSS) refers to the reduction in pleasantness of a food with its consumption relative to other unconsumed foods. In a typical SSS paradigm, the participants receive a range of food items to taste and evaluate and then one of the foods is consumed ad libitum until satiation. After the consumption of the test food, all the foods (including the test food) are then again tasted and evaluated. If SSS is the result of habituation this evaluation of the test food after its consumption would be subject to dishabituation (i.e. recovery of SSS) if the other unconsumed foods are evaluated first. To examine whether this is the case a total of 57 participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Test Food First (TFF; n=28) or Test Food Last (TFL; n=29). We hypothesized that group TFF would show stronger SSS than TFL. We found clear indication of SSS, but the degree of SSS did not differ between the two groups (F[1,55] {\textless}1). This finding suggests that SSS is unaffected by the sequence of tasting food items with its assessment. The potential implications for understanding SSS in terms of habituation are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {CONTEXT The relationship between obesity and osteoporosis has been widely studied, and epidemiological evidence shows that obesity is correlated with increased bone mass. Previous analyses, however, did not control for the mechanical loading effects of total body weight on bone mass and may have generated a confounded or even biased relationship between obesity and osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to reevaluate the relationship between obesity and osteoporosis by accounting for the mechanical loading effects of total body weight on bone mass. METHODS We measured whole body fat mass, lean mass, percentage fat mass, body mass index, and bone mass in two large samples of different ethnicity: 1988 unrelated Chinese subjects and 4489 Caucasian subjects from 512 pedigrees. We first evaluated the Pearson correlations among different phenotypes. We then dissected the phenotypic correlations into genetic and environmental components with bone mass unadjusted or adjusted for body weight. This allowed us to compare the results with and without controlling for mechanical loading effects of body weight on bone mass. RESULTS In both Chinese and Caucasian subjects, when the mechanical loading effect of body weight on bone mass was adjusted for, the phenotypic correlation (including its genetic and environmental components) between fat mass (or percentage fat mass) and bone mass was negative. Further multivariate analyses in subjects stratified by body weight confirmed the inverse relationship between bone mass and fat mass, after mechanical loading effects due to total body weight were controlled. CONCLUSIONS Increasing fat mass may not have a beneficial effect on bone mass.},

abstract = {Objective: To assist health professionals who counsel patients with overweight and obesity, a systematic review was undertaken to determine types of weight-loss interventions that contribute to successful outcomes and to define expected weight-loss outcomes from such interventions. Design: A search was conducted for weight-loss-focused randomized clinical trials with ???1-year follow-up. Eighty studies were identified and are included in the evidence table. Outcomes measures: The primary outcomes were a measure of weight loss at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Eight types of weight-loss interventions-diet alone, diet and exercise, exercise alone, meal replacements, very-low-energy diets, weight-loss medications (orlistat and sibutramine), and advice alone-were identified. By using simple pooling across studies, subjects mean amount of weight loss at each time point for each intervention was determined. Statistical analyses performed: Efficacy outcomes were calculated by meta-analysis and provide support for the pooled data. Hedges' gu was combined across studies to obtain an average effect size (and confidence level). Results: A mean weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5{\%} to 9{\%}) was observed during the first 6 months from interventions involving a reduced-energy diet and/or weight-loss medications with weight plateaus at approximately 6 months. In studies extending to 48 months, a mean 3 to 6 kg (3{\%} to 6{\%}) of weight loss was maintained with none of the groups experiencing weight regain to baseline. In contrast, advice-only and exercise-alone groups experienced minimal weight loss at any time point. Conclusions: Weight-loss interventions utilizing a reduced-energy diet and exercise are associated with moderate weight loss at 6 months. Although there is some regain of weight, weight loss can be maintained. The addition of weight-loss medications somewhat enhances weight-loss maintenance. ?? 2007 American Dietetic Association.},

abstract = {The association of bone with the metabolic syndrome and its features, visceral fat accumulation or insulin resistance, remains unclear. We determined visceral and subcutaneous fat areas (V and S) by computed tomography on 187 men (28-83 years) and 125 postmenopausal women (46-82 years) with type 2 diabetes. Men whose V was 100 cm(2) or more had significantly lower urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (p=0.005), higher femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) (p=0.004), and lower prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) (p=0.04) than controls. Fat mass, V, S, and lean body mass positively correlated with FN-BMD in men and with lumbar (L) and FN-BMD in women. When adjusted for weight, these correlations became negative. Urinary C-peptide positively correlated with FN-BMD in both genders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, height, weight, L-BMD, duration of diabetes, and diabetes therapies identified V in men and urinary C-peptide in women as factors inversely associated with the presence of VFs [odds ratio (OR)=0.61 per SD increase, p=0.04, and OR=0.32, p=0.01, respectively]. These findings suggest that, of the components of the metabolic syndrome, body fat in gravity and hyperinsulinemia could increase FN-BMD in diabetic subjects. Visceral fat in men and hyperinsulinemia in women may protect against VFs independent of weight, L-BMD, diabetes duration, or therapies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pok{\'{e}}mon GO is a location-based augmented reality game. Using GPS and the camera on a smartphone, the game requires players to travel in real world to capture animated creatures, called Pok{\'{e}}mon. We examined the impact of Pok{\'{e}}mon GO on physical activity (PA). METHODS AND RESULTS A pre-post observational study of 167 Pok{\'{e}}mon GO players who were self-enrolled through recruitment flyers or online social media was performed. Participants were instructed to provide screenshots of their step counts recorded by the iPhone Health app between June 15 and July 31, 2016, which was 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after the Pok{\'{e}}mon GO release date. Of 167 participants, the median age was 25 years (interquartile range, 21-29 years). The daily average steps of participants at baseline was 5678 (SD, 2833; median, 5718 [interquartile range, 3675-7279]). After initiation of Pok{\'{e}}mon GO, daily activity rose to 7654 steps (SD, 3616; median, 7232 [interquartile range, 5041-9744], pre-post change: 1976; 95{\%} CI, 1494-2458, or a 34.8{\%} relative increase [P{\textless}0.001]). On average, 10 000 "XP" points (a measure of game progression) was associated with 2134 additional steps per day (95{\%} CI, 1673-2595), suggesting a potential dose-response relationship. The number of participants achieving a goal of 10 000+ steps per day increased from 15.3{\%} before to 27.5{\%} after (odds ratio, 2.06; 95{\%} CI, 1.70-2.50). Increased PA was also observed in subgroups, with the largest increases seen in participants who spent more time playing Pok{\'{e}}mon GO, those who were overweight/obese, or those with a lower baseline PA level. CONCLUSIONS Pok{\'{e}}mon GO participation was associated with a significant increase in PA among young adults. Incorporating PA into gameplay may provide an alternative way to promote PA in persons who are attracted to the game. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The algorithm combines ideas from local learning, constraint-based, and search-and-score techniques in a principled and effective way. It first reconstructs the skeleton of a Bayesian network and then performs a Bayesian-scoring greedy hill-climbing search to orient the edges. In our extensive empirical evaluation MMHC out- performs on average and in terms of various metrics several prototypical and state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the PC, Sparse Candidate, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, Greedy Equivalence Search, and Greedy Search. These are the first empirical re- sults simultaneously comparing most of the major Bayesian network algorithms against each other. MMHC offers certain theoretical advantages, specifically over the Sparse Candidate algorithm, corroborated by our experiments.

abstract = {Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insufficiently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial variances of treatment effects and the residual between-trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random effects meta-regression. The associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespecification of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientific rationale for using meta-regression and the difficult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The causal effect of adipose tissue on bone mass and the direction of its net influence have not been directly assessed in adult humans. Using the Mendelian randomization analysis, we assessed the causality of adiposity in measurements of bone mass in adult males and females. DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects consisted of 2154 adults aged 25-54 years from a cross-sectional cohort of the employees of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. Body composition was determined after at least 3 h of fasting using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. A polymorphism in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO rs9939609) was used as an instrument in the Mendelian randomization analysis. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was 61.1{\%} TT, 33.9{\%} AT and 5.0{\%} AA. The average body mass index (BMI), body fat mass and percentage body fat were 23.9 kg/m(2) (SD = 3.6), 17.9 kg (SD = 6.6) and 26.8{\%} (SD = 7.2), respectively. The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was significantly correlated with BMI (coefficient = 0.673 kg/m(2) , P {\textless} 0.001), body fat mass (coefficient = 0.948 kg, P {\textless} 0.001) and percentage body fat (coefficient = 0.759{\%}, P {\textless} 0.01). An instrumental variable (IV) regression model, using BMI as the intermediate phenotype, suggested that FTO was a strong IV. Also, the FTO-BMI polymorphism was significantly associated with total hip and femoral neck BMD but was not correlated with total spine BMD, with estimated correlation coefficients of 0.0189 (95{\%} CI: 0.0046, 0.0332), 0.0149 (95{\%} CI: 0.0030, 0.0268) and 0.0025 (95{\%} CI: -0.0131, 0.0136) g/cm(2) , respectively. The variances of BMDs explained by the FTO-BMI were 19.0{\%}, 21.3{\%} and 1.1{\%}, respectively. Similar trends were also observed for the FTO-body fat mass and FTO-percentage body fat correlations. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analysis suggests that adiposity might be causally related to BMD at the femur but not at the spine.},

The estimation procedure is found to be quite robust for parameter values preset within appropriate limits for influenza. However, a significant difference is found between the preset and estimated household contact parameter for epidemics of medium and high intensity when the preset value is zero. Incremental increases in the household contact parameter are shown to produce marked increases in the overall infection attack rate demonstrating that household spread is an important link in maintaining infection in other mixing groups such as schools, preschool groups and neighbourhood clusters of households.},

We assessed the effect of DAG versus triacylglycerol (TAG) treatment on total energy expenditure (TEE), total fat oxidation (Fox) and respiratory quotient (RQ), and measured the oxidation rate of each oil using a respiratory chamber and the 13C-stable isotope. Eleven healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study. Subjects consumed an energy maintenance diet consisting of 55{\%} of total calories from carbohydrate, 15{\%} from protein and 30{\%} from fat during both the 3-day pre-chamber and 36-h chamber period. Fifty percent of the fat was test oil, containing either DAG oil or TAG oil. The oxidation rate of ingested test oils was determined by monitoring 13CO2 excretion in the breath from 13C-labeled diolein or 13C-labeled triolein. There were no significant differences in TEE, RQ and total Fox between the DAG and TAG treatment in the overall analysis. In the subgroup analysis, DAG treatment decreased RQ significantly in subjects with a high fat ratio (HFR) compared to TAG treatment. In addition, ingested diolein oxidation in DAG treatment was significantly faster than triolein oxidation in TAG treatment in the HFR group. Enhanced fat utilization with DAG treatment and rapid oxidation of ingested DAG may, at least in part, explain the greater loss of body weight and body fat related to DAG consumption found in the weight-loss studies.},

abstract = {The motivation to eat in humans is a complex process influenced by intrinsic mechanisms relating to the hunger and satiety cascade, and extrinsic mechanisms based on the appetitive incentive value of individual foods, which can themselves induce desire. This study was designed to investigate the neural basis of these two factors contributing to the control of motivation to eat within the same experimental design using positron emission tomography. Using a novel counterbalanced approach, participants were scanned in two separate sessions, once after fasting and once after food intake, in which they imagined themselves in a restaurant and considered a number of items on a menu, and were asked to choose their most preferred. All items were tailored to each individual and varied in their incentive value. No actual foods were presented. In response to a hungry state, increased activation was shown in the hypothalamus, amygdala and insula cortex as predicted, as well as the medulla, striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. Satiety, in contrast, was associated with increased activation in the lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex. Only activity in the vicinity of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex was observed in response to the processing of extrinsic appetitive incentive information. These results suggest that the contributions of intrinsic homeostatic influences, and extrinsic incentive factors to the motivation to eat, are somewhat dissociable neurally, with areas of convergence in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. The findings of this study have implications for research into the underlying mechanisms of eating disorders.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Green tea and green tea polyphenols have been shown to possess cancer preventive activities in preclinical model systems. In preparation for future green tea intervention trials, we have conducted a clinical study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of green tea polyphenols after 4 weeks of daily p.o. administration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or Polyphenon E (a defined, decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture). In an exploratory fashion, we have also determined the effect of chronic green tea polyphenol administration on UV-induced erythema response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Healthy participants with Fitzpatric skin type II or III underwent a 2-week run-in period and were randomly assigned to receive one of the five treatments for 4 weeks: 800 mg EGCG once/day, 400 mg EGCG twice/day, 800 mg EGCG as Polyphenon E once/day, 400 mg EGCG as Polyphenon E twice/day, or a placebo once/day (8 subjects/group). Samples were collected and measurements performed before and after the 4-week treatment period for determination of safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of green tea polyphenol treatment. RESULTS: Adverse events reported during the 4-week treatment period include excess gas, upset stomach, nausea, heartburn, stomach ache, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and muscle pain. All of the reported events were rated as mild events. For most events, the incidence reported in the polyphenol-treated groups was not more than that reported in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in blood counts and blood chemistry profiles after repeated administration of green tea polyphenol products. There was a {\textgreater}60{\%} increase in the area under the plasma EGCG concentration-time curve after 4 weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at a dosing schedule of 800 mg once daily. No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of EGCG after repeated green tea polyphenol treatment at a regimen of 400 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of the conjugated metabolites of epigallocatechin and epicatechin were not affected by repeated green tea polyphenol treatment. Four weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at the selected dose and dosing schedule did not provide protection against UV-induced erythema. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that it is safe for healthy individuals to take green tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the EGCG content in 8-16 cups of green tea once a day or in divided doses twice a day for 4 weeks. There is a {\textgreater}60{\%} increase in the systemic availability of free EGCG after chronic green tea polyphenol administration at a high daily bolus dose (800 mg EGCG or Polyphenon E once daily).},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for estimating lung density, air volume and changes in fluid content from a non-invasive measurement of the electrical resistivity of the lungs. Resistivity in $\Omega$ m was found by fitting measured electrical impedance tomography (EIT) data to a finite difference model of the thorax. Lung density was determined by comparing the resistivity of the lungs, measured at a relatively high frequency, with values predicted from a published model of lung structure. Lung air volume can then be calculated if total lung weight is also known. Temporal changes in lung fluid content will produce proportional changes in lung density. The method was implemented on EIT data, collected using eight electrodes placed in a single plane around the thorax, from 46 adult male subjects and 36 adult female subjects. Mean lung densities (±SD) of 246 ± 67 and 239 ± 64 kg m(-3), respectively, were obtained. In seven adult male subjects estimates of 1.68 ± 0.30, 3.42 ± 0.49 and 4.40 ± 0.53 l in residual volume, functional residual capacity and vital capacity, respectively, were obtained. Sources of error are discussed. It is concluded that absolute differences in lung density of about 30{\%} and changes over time of less than 30{\%} should be detected using the current technology in normal subjects. These changes would result from approximately 300 ml increase in lung fluid. The method proposed could be used for non-invasive monitoring of total lung air and fluid content in normal subjects but needs to be assessed in patients with lung disease.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies indicate that habitual coffee consumption lowers the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Postprandial hyperglycemia is a direct and independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We previously demonstrated that coffee polyphenol ingestion increased secretion of Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which has been shown to exhibit anti-diabetic and cardiovascular effects. We hypothesized coffee polyphenol consumption may improve postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular endothelial function by increasing GLP-1 release and/or reducing oxidative stress. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized, acute, crossover, intervention study in healthy male adults, measuring blood parameters and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) after ingestion of a meal with or without coffee polyphenol extract (CPE). Nineteen subjects consumed a test meal with either a placebo- or CPE-containing beverage. Blood biomarkers and FMD were measured at fasting and up to 180 minutes postprandially. The CPE beverage led to a significantly lower peak postprandial increase in blood glucose and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolite, and significantly higher postprandial FMD than the placebo beverage. Postprandial blood GLP-1 increase tended to be higher after ingestion of the CPE beverage, compared with placebo. Subclass analysis revealed that the CPE beverage significantly improved postprandial blood GLP-1 response and reduced blood glucose increase in the subjects with a lower insulinogenic index. Correlation analysis showed postprandial FMD was negatively associated with blood glucose increase after ingestion of the CPE beverage. In conclusion, these results suggest that coffee polyphenol consumption improves postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular endothelial function, which is associated with increased GLP-1 secretion and decreased oxidative stress in healthy humans.},

abstract = {The possibility of computing Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT) is an important feature of metabolic investigations. However, methodological problems have affected the determination of DIT in the indirect calorimetric chamber. DIT has been commonly estimated by regressing energy expenditure on a measure of physical activity. Although used for many years as the only feasible approach to calculate DIT in a respiratory chamber, this traditional method has been criticized because of an apparent underestimation of the DIT, but no alternative method has been suggested so far. The present work proposes to estimate DIT directly by means of a mathematical model. This approach also allows to simultaneously estimate other parameters, namely resting energy expenditure (REE), physical activity (PA) and physical exercise (PE). {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study involved 125 postpubertal obese adolescents (45 boys and 80 girls). Anthropometric measurements, body composition, visceral and subcutaneous fat, and BMD were determined. Leptin, adiponectin, and insulin levels also analyzed. RESULTS: Data demonstrated a negative relationship between BMD with insulin resistance, visceral fat and leptin concentration; and bone mineral content with visceral/subcutaneous ratio. Positive association between BMD and subcutaneous fat was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Visceral fat and insulin resistance, as well as visceral/subcutaneous ratio and leptin concentration, were negative predictors of BMD in boys and girls, respectively. However, subcutaneous fat had a protective influence in BMD only in boys.},

abstract = {Chlorogenic acid, an ester of caffeic acid and quinic acid, is a major phenolic compound in coffee; daily intake in coffee drinkers is 0.5–1 g. Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid are antioxidants in vitro and might therefore contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, data on the absorption of chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid in humans are lacking. We determined the absorption of chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid in a cross-over study with 4 female and 3 male healthy ileostomy subjects. In such subjects, degradation by the colonic microflora is minimal and absorption can be calculated as the amount ingested minus the amount excreted in ileostomy effluent. The ileostomy subjects ingested 2.8 mmol chlorogenic acid and 2.8 mmol caffeic acid on separate days in random order and subsequently collected ileostomy fluid and urine for 24 h. Absorption of chlorogenic acid was 33 Ϯ 17{\%} (mean Ϯ SD) and of caffeic acid 95 Ϯ 4{\%}. Traces of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 11{\%} of the ingested caffeic acid were excreted in urine. Thus, one third of chlorogenic acid and almost all of the caffeic acid were absorbed in the small intestine of humans. This implies that part of chlorogenic acid from foods will enter into the blood circulation, but most will reach the colon.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize meal patterns in relation to obesity in Swedish women using a simple instrument describing meal frequency, meal types and temporal distribution. DESIGN: Cross-sectional parallel group design. SUBJECTS: Eighty-three obese women from the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study were compared with 94 reference women, randomly recruited from the population. METHOD: A new, simplified and self-instructing questionnaire was used to assess meal patterns. Usual meal pattern was reported as time and meal type for each intake episode during a typical day. RESULTS: The obese women consumed 6.1 meals/day compared with 5.2 meals/day among the reference women (P{\textless}0.0001). All types of meals except 'drink meals' were significantly more frequently consumed in the obese group. The obese women also displayed a different meal pattern across the day, consuming a larger number of meals later in the day. As a result a larger fraction of each obese woman's total meals were consumed in the afternoon and in the evening/night. There was no difference in the number of obese vs reference women consuming breakfast. Snack meals were positively associated with total energy intake in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A new simplified method assessing meal pattern revealed that the number of reported intake occasions across a usual day was higher in obese women compared with controls and the timing was shifted to later in the day. These findings should be considered in the treatment of obesity.},

abstract = {Although weight, lean mass, fat mass and muscular strength are often found to be intercorrelated, the respective role of each parameter in bone mineral density (BMD) remains unknown in older women. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between body weight and composition and quadriceps strength on femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD in healthy postmenopausal women. The relationship between isokinetic quadriceps strength measured by Biodex and BMD measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was studied in 56 women aged 60-81 (70.5 +/- 6.2) years in multiple regression models adjusted for age, body composition and menopausal treatment. Weight and age were associated with femoral neck BMD (33 and 10{\%} of variance accounted for, respectively) and lumbar spine BMD (23 and 8{\%} of its variance). When body weight and quadriceps strength were excluded from the model, lean mass and age were associated with femoral neck BMD (29 and 14{\%} of variance explained, respectively) and lumbar spine BMD (28 and 11{\%} of variance explained, respectively). When quadriceps strength was entered into the model, it was strongly associated with femoral neck BMD (30{\%} of variance accounted for), in addition to lean mass (9{\%}) and age (7{\%}), whereas it was not associated with lumbar spine BMD. In conclusion, lean mass explains a great part of the strong association between body weight and femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD. Quadriceps strength explains a great part of the association between lean mass and BMD at the femoral neck site but not at the lumbar spine site. These results suggest a site-specific effect of muscular strength on bone and a potential role of the age-related decline of muscle strength in age-related bone loss in postmenopausal women.},

abstract = {A rapid liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous quantification of caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid and sucrose in coffee was developed and validated. The method involved extraction with hot water, clarification with basic lead acetate and membrane filtration, followed by chromatographic separation using a Spherisorb?? S5 ODS2, 5 ??m chromatographic column and gradient elution with 0.3{\%} aqueous formic acid/methanol at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The electrospray ionization source was operated in the negative mode to generate sucrose ions and in the positive mode to generate caffeine, trigonelline and nicotinic acid ions. Ionization suppression of all analytes was found due to matrix effect. Calibrations curves prepared in green and roasted coffee extracts were linear with r2 {\textgreater} 0.999. Roasted coffee was spiked and recoveries ranged from 93.0{\%} to 105.1{\%} for caffeine, from 85.2{\%} to 116.2{\%} for trigonelline, from 89.6{\%} to 113.5{\%} for nicotinic acid and from 94.1{\%} to 109.7{\%} for sucrose. Good repeatibilities (RSD {\textless} 5{\%}) were found for all analytes in the matrix. The limit of detection (LOD), calculated on the basis of signal-to-noise ratios of 3:1, was 11.9, 36.4, 18.5 and 5.0 ng/mL for caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid and sucrose, respectively. Analysis of 11 coffee samples (regular or decaffeinated green, ground roasted and instant) gave results in agreement with the literature. The method showed to be suitable for different types of coffee available in the market thus appearing as a fast and reliable alternative method to be used for routine coffee analysis. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Individual-based epidemiology models are increasingly used in the study of influenza epidemics. Several studies on influenza dynamics and evaluation of intervention measures have used the same incubation and infectious period distribution parameters based on the natural history of influenza. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the influence of slight changes to these parameters (in addition to the transmissibility) would be useful for future studies and real-time modeling during an influenza pandemic.In this study, we examined individual and joint effects of parameters and ranked parameters based on their influence on the dynamics of simulated epidemics. We also compared the sensitivity of the model across synthetic social networks for Montgomery County in Virginia and New York City (and surrounding metropolitan regions) with demographic and rural-urban differences. In addition, we studied the effects of changing the mean infectious period on age-specific epidemics. The research was performed from a public health standpoint using three relevant measures: time to peak, peak infected proportion and total attack rate. We also used statistical methods in the design and analysis of the experiments. The results showed that: (i) minute changes in the transmissibility and mean infectious period significantly influenced the attack rate; (ii) the mean of the incubation period distribution appeared to be sufficient for determining its effects on the dynamics of epidemics; (iii) the infectious period distribution had the strongest influence on the structure of the epidemic curves; (iv) the sensitivity of the individual-based model was consistent across social networks investigated in this study and (v) age-specific epidemics were sensitive to changes in the mean infectious period irrespective of the susceptibility of the other age groups. These findings suggest that small changes in some of the disease model parameters can significantly influence the uncertainty observed in real-time forecasting and predicting of the characteristics of an epidemic.},

abstract = {Analysis and interpretation of functional MRI (fMRI) data have traditionally been based on identifying areas of significance on a thresholded statistical map of the entire imaged brain volume. This form of analysis can be likened to a "fishing expedition." As we become more knowledgeable about the structure-function relationships of different brain regions, tools for a priori hypothesis testing are needed. These tools must be able to generate region of interest masks for a priori hypothesis testing consistently and with minimal effort. Current tools that generate region of interest masks required for a priori hypothesis testing can be time-consuming and are often laboratory specific. In this paper we demonstrate a method of hypothesis-driven data analysis using an automated atlas-based masking technique. We provide a powerful method of probing fMRI data using automatically generated masks based on lobar anatomy, cortical and subcortical anatomy, and Brodmann areas. Hemisphere, lobar, anatomic label, tissue type, and Brodmann area atlases were generated in MNI space based on the Talairach Daemon. Additionally, we interfaced these multivolume atlases to a widely used fMRI software package, SPM99, and demonstrate the use of the atlas tool with representative fMRI data. This tool represents a necessary evolution in fMRI data analysis for testing of more spatially complex hypotheses. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objectives: Serum ferritin increases in various disorders and clinical conditions. However, causal associations between the serum ferritin level and clinical factors that influence serum ferritin level are not well characterized. We report a model that quantitatively analyzes the causal relations between the serum ferritin level and clinical factors. Design and methods: We analyzed the ferritin level and other laboratory data in the sera of 274 patients. Structural equation modeling was used to verify causal relations and the adequacy of latent factors. Results: Three factors representing clinical status were identified: cell damage, hepatic function, and inflammation. Serum iron (SI) had the strongest effect on serum ferritin elevation. The effect of the cell damage factor on serum ferritin indicated cell destruction, and that of the hepatic function factor represented decreased serum ferritin clearance. The cell damage factor also indirectly increased the ferritin level via SI or the hepatic function factor. The total effect of the inflammatory status factor on ferritin level was very weak. Conclusions: These causal relations may explain the mechanism of serum ferritin level elevation in various clinical conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic has unfolded in a matter of decades, not millennia, and therefore cannot be attributed to a drift in the genome. Rather, the temporal characteristics of the epidemic more closely track environmental and lifestyle changes, such as reduced physical activity, increased availability of palatable and energy-dense foods and drinks, and increased acceptance of eating outside of meal time (among others). One important observation is that not everyone is becoming obese. This suggests that individual factors interact with recent environmental changes to predispose some to overeat. One hypothesis that has been gaining traction in the neuroscience community is that individual differences in the neural encoding of foods may predispose some to overeat in the presence of a surplus of energy-dense, palatable foods and drinks. The aim of this review is to highlight several possible ways by which individual differences in the neurophysiology of food reward may lead to overeating.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Green tea(GT) is able to increase energy expenditure(EE) and fat oxidation(FATox) via inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase(COMT) by catechins. However, this does not always appear unanimously because of large inter-individual variability. This may be explained by different alleles of the functional COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism that are associated with COMT enzyme activity; high-activity enzyme, COMT(H)(Val/Val genotype), and low-activity COMT(L)(Met/Met genotype). METHODS: Fourteen Caucasian subjects (BMI: 22.2±2.3 kg/m2, age: 21.4±2.2 years) of whom 7 with the COMT(H)-genotype and 7 with the COMT(L)-genotype were included in a randomized, cross-over study in which EE and substrate oxidation were measured with a ventilated-hood system after decaffeinated GT and placebo(PL) consumption. RESULTS: At baseline, EE, RQ, FATox and carbohydrate oxidation(CHOox) did not differ between groups. Significant interactions were observed between COMT genotypes and treatment for RQ, FATox and CHOox (p{\textless}0.05). After GT vs. PL, EE(GT: 62.2 vs. PL: 35.4 kJ.3.5 hrs; p{\textless}0.01), RQ(GT: 0.80 vs. PL: 0.83; p{\textless}0.01), FATox(GT: 18.3 vs. PL: 15.3 g/d; p{\textless}0.001) and CHOox(GT: 18.5 vs. PL: 24.3 g/d; p{\textless}0.001) were significantly different for subjects carrying the COMT(H) genotype, but not for subjects carrying the COMT(L) genotype (EE, GT: 60.3 vs. PL: 51.7 kJ.3.5 hrs; NS), (RQ, GT: 0.81 vs. PL: 0.81; NS), (FATox, GT: 17.3 vs. PL: 17.0 g/d; NS), (CHOox, GT: 22.1 vs. PL: 21.4 g/d; NS). CONCLUSION: Subjects carrying the COMT(H) genotype increased energy expenditure and fat-oxidation upon ingestion of green tea catechins vs, placebo, whereas COMT(L) genotype carriers reacted similarly to GT and PL ingestion. The differences in responses were due to the different responses on PL ingestion, but similar responses to GT ingestion, pointing to different mechanisms. The different alleles of the functional COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism appear to play a role in the inter-individual variability for EE and FATox after GT treatment.

As for pharmacotherapy in osteoporosis with diabetes, there is so far no specific recommendation.

abstract = {The ability to maintain adequate nutrient intake is critical for survival. Complex interrelated neuronal circuits have developed in the mammalian brain to regulate many aspects of feeding behaviour, from food-seeking to meal termination. The hypothalamus and brainstem are thought to be the principal homeostatic brain areas responsible for regulating body weight. However, in the current 'obesogenic' human environment food intake is largely determined by non-homeostatic factors including cognition, emotion and reward, which are primarily processed in corticolimbic and higher cortical brain regions. Although the pleasure of eating is modulated by satiety and food deprivation increases the reward value of food, there is currently no adequate neurobiological account of this interaction between homeostatic and higher centres in the regulation of food intake in humans. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that peptide YY3-36 (PYY), a physiological gut-derived satiety signal, modulates neural activity within both corticolimbic and higher-cortical areas as well as homeostatic brain regions. Under conditions of high plasma PYY concentrations, mimicking the fed state, changes in neural activity within the caudolateral orbital frontal cortex predict feeding behaviour independently of meal-related sensory experiences. In contrast, in conditions of low levels of PYY, hypothalamic activation predicts food intake. Thus, the presence of a postprandial satiety factor switches food intake regulation from a homeostatic to a hedonic, corticolimbic area. Our studies give insights into the neural networks in humans that respond to a specific satiety signal to regulate food intake. An increased understanding of how such homeostatic and higher brain functions are integrated may pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies for obesity.},

abstract = {Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites generally involved in plant adaptation to environmental stress conditions. Chlorogenic acids (CGA) and related compounds are the main components of the phenolic fraction of green coffee beans, reaching levels up to 14 {\%} (dry matter basis). These compounds have a number of beneficial health properties related to their potent antioxidant activity as well as hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic and antiviral activities. The main groups of CGA found in green coffee beans include caffeoylquinic acids, dicaffeoylquinic acids, feruloylquinic acids, p-coumaroylquinic acids and mixed diesters of caffeic and ferulic acids with quinic acid, each group with at least three isomers. During coffee processing, CGA may be isomerized, hydrolyzed or degraded into low molecular weight compounds. The high temperatures of roasting also produce transformation of part of CGA into quinolactones and, along with other compounds, melanoidins. This review focuses on the chemical characteristics, biosynthesis, and distribution of CGA and related compounds in coffee. The influence of genetic, physiological and environmental factors as well as processing on the chemical composition of coffee beans is discussed. The impact of CGA composition of green coffee on cup quality is also approached. Despite the existence of substantial published information on the total levels of CGA in coffee, more research is needed on the composition of minor phenolic compounds and specific CGA isomers (and related substances) in green and roasted coffee beans, as well as their impact on coffee quality.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s) Exposure assessment is a fundamental part of the risk assessment paradigm, but can often present a number of challenges and uncertainties. This is especially the case for process contaminants formed during the processing, e.g. heating of food, since they are in part highly reactive and/or volatile, thus making exposure assessment by analysing contents in food unreliable. New approaches are therefore required to accurately assess consumer exposure and thus better inform the risk assessment. Such novel approaches may include the use of biomarkers, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling-facilitated reverse dosimetry, and/or duplicate diet studies. This review focuses on the state of the art with respect to the use of biomarkers of exposure for the process contaminants acrylamide, 3-MCPD esters, glycidyl esters, furan and acrolein. From the overview presented, it becomes clear that the field of assessing human exposure to process-related contaminants in food by biomarker monitoring is promising and strongly developing. The current state of the art as well as the existing data gaps and challenges for the future were defined. They include (1) using PBK modelling and duplicate diet studies to establish, preferably in humans, correlations between external exposure and biomarkers; (2) elucidation of the possible endogenous formation of the process-related contaminants and the resulting biomarker levels; (3) the influence of inter-individual variations and how to include that in the biomarker-based exposure predictions; (4) the correction for confounding factors; (5) the value of the different biomarkers in relation to exposure scenario's and risk assessment, and (6) the possibilities of novel methodologies. In spite of these challenges it can be concluded that biomarker-based exposure assessment provides a unique opportunity to more accurately assess consumer exposure to process-related contaminants in food and thus to better inform risk assessment.},

abstract = {Regularization algorithms are often used to produce reasonable solutions to ill-posed problems. The L-curve is a plot—for all valid regularization parameters—of the size of the regularized solution versus the size of the corresponding residual. Two main results are established. First a unifying characterization of various regularization methods is given and it is shown that the measurement of “size” is dependent on the particular regularization method chosen. For example, the 2-norm is appropriate for Tikhonov regularization, but a 1-norm in the coordinate system of the singular value decomposition (SVD) is relevant to truncated SVD regularization. Second, a new method is proposed for choosing the regularization parameter based on the L-curve, and it is shown how this method can be implemented efficiently. The method is compared to generalized cross validation and this new method is shown to be more robust in the presence of correlated errors.},

abstract = {Objective Two investigations evaluate Bayesian meta-regression for detecting treatment interactions. Study design and setting The first compares analyses of aggregate and individual patient data on 1,860 subjects from 11 trials testing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for nondiabetic kidney disease. The second explores meta-regression for detecting treatment interaction on 671 covariates, including the baseline risk, from 232 meta-analyses of binary outcomes compiled from the Cochrane Collaboration and the medical literature. Results In the ACE inhibitor study, treatment effects were homogeneous so meta-regression identified no interactions. Analysis of individual patient data using a multilevel model, however, discovered that treatment reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) more among patients with higher baseline proteinuria. The second investigation found meta-regression most effective for detecting treatment interactions with study-level factors in meta-analyses with {\textgreater}10 studies, heterogeneous treatment effects, or significant overall treatment effects. Under all three conditions, 46{\%} of meta-regressions produced strong interactions (posterior probability {\textgreater}0.995) compared with 6{\%} otherwise. Baseline risk was associated with the odds ratio in 6{\%} of meta-analyses, half the rate found using maximum likelihood. Conclusion Meta-regression can detect interactions of treatment with study-level factors when treatment effects are heterogeneous. Individual patient data are needed for patient-level factors and homogeneous effects. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Green tea polyphenols were previously found to protect normal epithelial cells from reactive oxygen species, and to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. The current study investigated whether -(-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major green tea polyphenol, protects normal salivary gland cells from the effects of gamma-irradiation and the chemotherapy drug cis-platinum(II)diammine dichloride (CDDP). Human immortalized salivary acinar and ductal cells, and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells were irradiated with gamma-rays or treated with CDDP, with or without pretreatment with EGCG, followed by MTT and BrdU incorporation assays. The results demonstrated that EGCG protected the normal salivary gland cells from chemical or irradiation-induced damage. However, protection of oral cancer cells by EGCG was also observed if EGCG was at physiologically achievable salivary concentrations but not at higher concentrations, suggesting that the combination of green tea consumption with cancer therapy requires further evaluation.},

abstract = {Frequency-dependent electrical properties (EPs; conductivity and permittivity) of biological tissues provide important diagnostic information (e.g., tumor characterization), and also play an important role in quantifying radiofrequency (RF) coil induced specific absorption rate (SAR), which is a major safety concern in high- and ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. Cross-sectional imaging of EPs has been pursued for decades. Recently introduced electrical properties tomography (EPT) approaches utilize the measurable RF magnetic field induced by the RF coil in an MRI system to quantitatively reconstruct the EP distribution in vivo and noninvasively with a spatial resolution of a few millimeters or less. This paper reviews the EPT approach from its basic theory in electromagnetism to the state-of-the-art research outcomes. Emphasizing on the imaging reconstruction methods rather than experimentation techniques, we review the developed imaging algorithms, validation results in physical phantoms and biological tissues, as well as their applications in in vivo tumor detection and subject-specific SAR prediction. Challenges for future research are also discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of applying a novel level set reconstruction technique to electrical imaging of the human brain. We focus particularly on the potential application of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to cryosurgery monitoring. In this application, cancerous tissue is treated by a local freezing technique using a small needle-like cryosurgery probe. The interface between frozen and nonfrozen tissue can be expected to have a relatively high contrast in conductivity and we treat the inverse problem of locating and monitoring this interface during the treatment. A level set method is used as a powerful and flexible tool for tracking the propagating interfaces during the monitoring process. For calculating sensitivities and the Jacobian when deforming the interfaces we employ an adjoint formula rather than a direct differentiation technique. In particular, we are using a narrow-band technique for this procedure. This combination of an adjoint technique and a narrow-band technique for calculating Jacobians results in a computationally efficient and extremely fast method for solving the inverse problem. Moreover, due to the reduced number of unknowns in each step of the narrow-band approach compared to a pixel- or voxel-based technique, our reconstruction scheme tends to be much more stable. We demonstrate that our new method also outperforms its pixel-/voxel-based counterparts in terms of image quality in this application.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop a clinical method for evaluating skeletal muscle (SM) mass using whole-body bioelectrical impedance (BI) analysis in the standing position. Subjects: Two hundred and forty-four volunteers (men = 106 and women = 138) participated in this study. The subjects were randomly separated into validation and cross-validation groups. Methods: The whole-body impedance (Z) between the hands and feet was measured in the standing position. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to develop the prediction equation for SM mass. Whole-body SM mass, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was used as a reference. Results: BI index (height2/Z), body surface area (BSA), gender, and age were selected as significant contributors to predict SM in the validation group. There was no significant difference between the measured and estimated SM mass and no systematic error in BI analysis in the cross-validation group. All data were pooled to generate the final regression equation:SM mass (kg) = (0.126 ?? BI index) + (1.937 ?? BSA) + (- 0.062 ?? age) + (- 2.186 ?? gender) - 2.881,where age is in years. Gender for men = 1 and women = 2. Analysis revealed that the slope and intercept were not significantly different from one and zero, respectively. The r2 and SEE values of the regression equation were 0.893 and 1.65 kg, respectively. Conclusions: Using our developed prediction equation, the BIA system can be used to accurately evaluate whole-body skeletal muscle mass with the subject in the standing position. ?? 2009 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract = {Background: The objective of this study was to characterize the neurogenic contraction and relaxation of the human gastroepiploic artery and to determine whether the responses are mediated by nitric oxide (NO) from neural or endothelial origin. Methods: Rings of human gastroepiploic artery were obtained from 18 patients (12 men, 6 women) undergoing gastrectomy. The rings were suspended in organ baths for isometric recording of tension. We studied the contractile and relaxant responses to electrical field stimulation. Results: In arteries under resting conditions, electrical field stimulation (2 to 8 Hz) caused frequency-dependent contractions that were of greater magnitude in arteries denuded of endothelium and blocked by tetrodotoxin (10-6 mol/L). The inhibitor of NO synthesis NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 10-4 mol/L) increased contractile responses only in arteries with endothelium. In preparations contracted with norepinephrine in the presence of guanethidine (10-6 mol/L) and atropine (10-6 mol/L), electrical stimulation induced frequency-dependent relaxations. This neurogenic relaxation was prevented by L-NMMA (10-4 mol/L) and tetrodotoxin (10-6 mol/L), but was unaffected by removal of the endothelium. Conclusions: The results provide functional evidence that NO is released by autonomic nerves of the human gastroepiploic artery. We hypothesize that the release of NO from both endothelial and neurogenic origin may modulate resistance of the human gastroepiploic artery. Dysfunction in any of these sources of NO should be considered in some form of vasospasm. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {Use of the final size distribution of minor outbreaks for the estimation of the reproduction numbers of supercritical epidemic processes has yet to be considered. We used a branching process model to derive the final size distribution of minor outbreaks, assuming a reproduction number above unity, and applying the method to final size data for pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a spatially limited setting. Because the final size distribution of a minor outbreak needs to be normalized by the probability of extinction, we assume that the dispersion parameter (k) of the negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k=1, the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.97-1.38). When less dispersed with k=2, the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number was 1.14. These estimates agreed with those published from transmission network analysis, indicating that the human-to-human transmission potential of the pneumonic plague is not very high. Given only minor outbreaks, transmission potential is not sufficiently assessed by directly counting the number of offspring. Since the absence of a major epidemic does not guarantee a subcritical process, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard epidemic data from minor outbreaks as supercritical, and yield estimates of threshold values above unity. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness (VE) are generally measured as 1 minus some measure of relative risk (RR) in the vaccinated group compared with the unvaccinated group (VE = 1 - RR). In designing a study to evaluate vaccination, the type of effect and the question of interest determine the appropriate choice of comparison population and parameter. Possible questions of interest include that of the biologic effect of vaccination on susceptibility, on infectiousness, or on progression to disease in individuals. The indirect effects, total effects, and overall public health benefits of widespread vaccination of individuals within the context of a vaccination program might also be of primary concern. The change in behavior induced by belief in the protective effects of vaccination might influence the estimates of these effects or might itself be of interest. In this paper, the authors present a framework of study designs that relates the scientific question of interest to the choice of comparison groups, the unit of observation, the level of information available for analysis, and the parameter of effect.},

abstract = {Background . The main criticism of the definition of “osteosarcopenic obesity” (OSO) is the lack of division between subcutaneous and visceral fat. This study describes the prevalence, metabolic profile, and risk factors of two new phenotypes of sarcopenia: osteosarcopenic visceral obesity (OSVAT) and osteosarcopenic subcutaneous obesity (OSSAT). Methods . A standardized geriatric assessment was performed by anthropometric and biochemical measures. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to assess body composition, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), osteoporosis, and sarcopenia. Results . A sample of 801 subjects were assessed (247 men; 554 women). The prevalence of osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO) was 6.79{\%}; OSSAT and OSOVAT were, respectively, 2.22{\%} and 4.56{\%}. OSVAT (versus the others) showed a higher level of inflammation (CRP and ESR, p {\textless} 0.05 ), bilirubin ( p {\textless} 0.05 ), and risk of fractures (FRAX index over 15{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001 ). Subjects with OSSAT did not show any significant risk factors associated to obesity. Conclusions . The osteosarcopenic visceral obesity phenotype (OSVAT) seems to be associated with a higher risk of fractures, inflammation, and a worse metabolic profile. These conditions in OSVAT cohort are associated with an increase of visceral adipose tissue, while patients with OSSAT seem to benefit related to the “obesity paradox.”},

abstract = {Since their entry to Japan in the latter half of the 19th century, coffee and coffee shops have been closely linked to the economic, political, and socio-cultural change undergone by the Japanese society. The caf{\'{e}}s themselves have gone through numerous transform-ations in order to address the various social needs of their patrons. Today, coffee shops occupy a significant niche in the Japanese urban lifestyle. However, the cultural 'baggage' of coffee as a foreign commodity still plays a central role in generating its consumer appeal. Coffee is a global commodity whose value on the world market is surpassed only by oil. Moreover, due to its peculiar historical background, it became a beverage charged with a wide range of cultural meanings; tracing these meanings in different contexts can shed light on the way cultural commodities 'behave' in the globalized world. In order to examine the niche that coffee occupies in the Japanese consumption scene, I will analyze the manner in which representations of coffee are constructed and translated into a consumer experience. Through the case of coffee in Japan I will try to demonstrate the process of 'movement of culture', whereby the relevance of a foreign commodity in the local context is determined by the complex interplay between two culturally engineered binary entities of 'global' and 'local', 'foreign' and 'native'.},

abstract = {A method for obtaining electrocardiographic potential through thin cloth inserted between the measuring electrodes and the skin of a subject's dorsal surface when lying supine has been proposed. The method is based on capacitive coupling involving the electrode, the cloth, and the skin. Examination of a pilot device which employed the method revealed the following: (1) In spite of the gain attenuation in the high frequency region, the proposed method was considered useful for monitoring electrogardiogram (ECG) for nondiagnostic purpose. (2) The method was able to yield a stable ECG from a subject at rest for at least 7 h, and there was no significant adverse effect of long-term measurement on the quality of the signal obtained. (3) Electrode area was the factor that had most influence on the signal, compared with other factors such as cloth thickness and coupling pressure, but could be reduced to 10 cm2 for heart rate detection. (4) Input capacitance of the device was assumed to be the dominant factor for the gain attenuation in the high frequency region, and should be reduced with a view to diagnostic use. Although there is still room for improvement in terms of practical use, the proposed method appears promising for application to bedding as a noninvasive and awareness-free method for ECG monitoring.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a lowcost, non-invasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung. Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilatorinduced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of EIT is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct EIT images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we therefore seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of 4 EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there are no previous reports that assessed the association between dietary patterns and risk of dementia in Asian populations. OBJECTIVE: We investigated dietary patterns and their potential association with risk of incident dementia in a general Japanese population. DESIGN: A total of 1006 community-dwelling Japanese subjects without dementia, aged 60-79 y, were followed up for a median of 15 y. The reduced rank regression procedure was used to efficiently determine their dietary patterns. Estimated risk conferred by a particular dietary pattern on the development of dementia was computed by using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Seven dietary patterns were extracted; of these, dietary pattern 1 was correlated with high intakes of soybeans and soybean products, vegetables, algae, and milk and dairy products and a low intake of rice. During the follow-up, 271 subjects developed all-cause dementia. Of these individuals, 144 subjects had Alzheimer disease (AD), and 88 subjects had vascular dementia (VaD). After adjustment for potential confounders, risks of development of all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD were reduced by 0.66 (95{\%} CI: 0.46, 0.95), 0.65 (95{\%} CI: 0.40, 1.06), and 0.45 (95{\%} CI: 0.22, 0.91), respectively, in subjects in the highest quartile of score for dietary pattern 1 compared with subjects in the lowest quartile. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a higher adherence to a dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of soybeans and soybean products, vegetables, algae, and milk and dairy products and a low intake of rice is associated with educed risk of dementia in the general Japanese population.},

abstract = {Automated organ segmentation from medical images is an indispensable component for clinical applications such as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and computer-assisted surgery (CAS). We utilize a multi-atlas segmentation scheme, which has recently been used in different approaches in the literature to achieve more accurate and robust segmentation of anatomical structures in computed tomography (CT) volume data. Among abdominal organs, the pancreas has large inter-patient variability in its position, size and shape. Moreover, the CT intensity of the pancreas closely resembles adjacent tissues, rendering its segmentation a challenging task. Due to this, conventional intensity-based atlas selection for pancreas segmentation often fails to select atlases that are similar in pancreas position and shape to those of the unlabeled target volume. In this paper, we propose a new atlas selection strategy based on vessel structure around the pancreatic tissue and demonstrate its application to a multi-atlas pancreas segmentation. Our method utilizes vessel structure around the pancreas to select atlases with high pancreatic resemblance to the unlabeled volume. Also, we investigate two types of applications of the vessel structure information to the atlas selection. Our segmentations were evaluated on 150 abdominal contrast-enhanced CT volumes. The experimental results showed that our approach can segment the pancreas with an average Jaccard index of 66.3{\%} and an average Dice overlap coefficient of 78.5{\%}.},

It is necessary to solve an inverse problem to estimate the cortical dipole distribution from the scalp potentials. In the present study, the accuracy of cortical dipole imaging was improved by focusing on filtering property of the spatial inverse filter. We proposed an inverse filter that optimizes filtering property using a sigmoid function. The ability of the proposed method was compared with the traditional inverse techniques, such as Tikhonov regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), and truncated total least squares (TTLS), in a computer simulation. The proposed method was applied to human experimental data of visual evoked potentials. As a result, the estimation accuracy was improved and the localized dipole distribution was obtained with less noise.},

OBJECTIVE Determine whether medical mask use by sick individuals with ILI protects well contacts from related respiratory infections. SETTING 6 major hospitals in 2 districts of Beijing, China. DESIGN Cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS 245 index cases with ILI. INTERVENTION Index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) and control arms (n=122). Since 43 index cases in the control arm also used a mask during the study period, an as-treated post hoc analysis was performed by comparing outcomes among household members of index cases who used a mask (mask group) with household members of index cases who did not use a mask (no-mask group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Primary outcomes measured in household members were clinical respiratory illness, ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection. RESULTS In an intention-to-treat analysis, rates of clinical respiratory illness (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95{\%} CI 0.18 to 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95{\%} CI 0.03 to 3.13) and laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95{\%} CI 0.06 to 15.54) were consistently lower in the mask arm compared with control, although not statistically significant. A post hoc comparison between the mask versus no-mask groups showed a protective effect against clinical respiratory illness, but not against ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS The study indicates a potential benefit of medical masks for source control, but is limited by small sample size and low secondary attack rates. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy of medical masks as source control. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER ACTRN12613000852752; Results.},

METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and summarize the findings of these studies. We identified 27 articles, around half of which reported studies conducted in May and June 2009. RESULTS In 13 of the 27 studies (48{\%}) that collected respiratory specimens from household contacts, point estimates of the risk of secondary infection ranged from 3{\%} to 38{\%}, with substantial heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses revealed that a part of the heterogeneity reflected varying case ascertainment and study designs. The estimates of symptomatic secondary infection risk, based on 20 studies identifying febrile acute respiratory illness among household contacts, also showed substantial variability, with point estimates ranging from 4{\%} to 37{\%}. CONCLUSIONS Transmission of the 2009 pandemic virus in households appeared to vary among countries and settings, with differences in estimates of the secondary infection risk also partly due to differences in study designs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS$\backslash$nThe effects of isoflavones on bone loss appear inconsistent in randomized controlled trials. Therefore, we used a statistical method of combining these diverse data to clarify the effects of soy isoflavone intake on spine bone loss. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$nWe identified randomized controlled trials related to the effects of soy isoflavone intake on spine bone mineral density or spine bone mineral content and performed meta-analysis with Review Manager 4.2 software. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nTen studies with a total of 608 subjects were selected for meta-analysis. The spine bone mineral density in subjects who consumed isoflavones increased significantly by 20.6mg/cm2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 4.5–36.6mg/cm2) in comparison to that in subjects who did not consume isoflavones. Isoflavone intake vs placebo intake increased spine bone mineral content by 0.93g (95{\%} confidence interval: −0.37 to 2.24g) with borderline significance. Increases in the spine bone mineral density with isoflavone intake of more than 90mg/day and with treatment lasting 6 months were 28.5mg/cm2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 8.4–48.6mg/cm2) and 27mg/cm2 (95{\%} confidence interval: 8.3–45.8mg/cm2), respectively. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS$\backslash$nIsoflavone intervention significantly attenuates bone loss of the spine in menopausal women. These favorable effects become more significant when more than 90mg/day of isoflavones are consumed. And soy isoflavone consumption for 6 months can be enough to exert beneficial effects on bone in menopausal women.},

The microbiota that colonises the gut is now being considered as a virtual organ or emergent system, with properties that need to be integrated into host biology and physiology. Unlike other organs, the functions that the gut microbiota plays in the host are as yet not fully understood and can be quite easily disrupted by antibiotics, diet or surgery. In this review, we look at some of the best-characterised functions that only the gut microbiota plays and how it interacts with the host's endocrine system and we try to make it clear that the 21st-century biology cannot afford to ignore this facet of biology, if it wants to fully understand what makes us human.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The relation between being deprived of a food and intake and craving for that food was investigated in restrained and unrestrained eaters. METHOD: For 1 week, 103 female undergraduate students were assigned to be chocolate deprived, vanilla deprived, or nondeprived. Only chocolate deprivation was expected to elicit cravings, as chocolate is not easily substituted, whereas vanilla is. RESULTS: The main effect of chocolate deprivation on consumption was qualified by an interaction with restraint. Chocolate-deprived restrained eaters consumed more chocolate food than did any other group. Restrained eaters experienced more food cravings than did unrestrained eaters and were more likely to eat the craved food. Moreover, restrained eaters deprived of chocolate spent the least time doing an anagram task before a "taste-rating task" in which they expected that chocolate foods might be available. CONCLUSION: Converging measures of craving indicate that deprivation causes craving and overeating, but primarily in restrained eaters.},

Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the prospective association between the Mediterranean-style dietary pattern and metabolic syndrome. Design: The Mediterranean-style dietary pattern score (MSDPS) was used to characterize a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort. We examined the longitudinal association between MSDPS and metabolic syndrome traits (including homeostasis model assessment–insulin resistance, fasting glucose, waist circumference, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) among 2730 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort without type 2 diabetes (baseline median age: 54 y; 55{\%} women), who were followed from the fifth (baseline) to the seventh study examinations (mean follow-up time: 7 y), and metabolic syndrome incidence (according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition) in 1918 participants free of the condition at baseline. Results: A higher MSDPS was associated with lower homeostasis model assessment–insulin resistance (P = 0.02), waist circumference (P {\textless} 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.03), and triglycerides (P {\textless} 0.001) and higher HDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) after adjustment for the corresponding baseline values and for several confounding factors associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Participants in the highest quintile category of the MSDPS had a lower incidence of metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quintile category (38.5{\%} compared with 30.1{\%}; P = 0.01). Conclusion: Our study suggests that the consumption of a diet consistent with the principles of the Mediterranean-style diet may protect against metabolic syndrome in Americans.},

In the last two decades, a variety of super-resolution methods have been proposed. These methods are usually very sensitive to their assumed model of data and noise, which limits their utility. This paper reviews some of these methods and addresses their short-comings. We propose an alternate approach using L1 norm minimization and robust regularization based on a bilateral prior to deal with different data and noise models. This computationally inexpensive method is robust to errors in motion and blur estimation and results in images with sharp edges. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its superiority to other super-resolution methods.},

Causality inference in nutritional epidemiology is largely based on evidence from studies of observational design, and may be distorted by unmeasured or residual confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization is a recently developed methodology that combines genetic and classical epidemiological analysis to infer causality for environmental exposures, based on the principle of Mendel's law of independent assortment. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures of interest. Associations derived from Mendelian randomization analysis are less likely to be affected by confounding and reverse causation. During the past 5 years, a body of studies examined the causal effects of diet/lifestyle factors and biomarkers on a variety of diseases. The Mendelian randomization approach also holds considerable promise in the study of intrauterine influences on offspring health outcomes. However, the application of Mendelian randomization in nutritional epidemiology has some limitations.},

The term osteosarcopenic obesity has been coined to describe the concurrent appearance of obesity in individuals with low bone and muscle mass. Although our understanding of osteosarcopenic obesity's etiology, prevalence, and consequences is extremely limited, it is reasonable to infer its negative impact in a population that is aging in an obesogenic environment. It is likely that these individuals will present with poorer clinical outcomes caused by the cascade of metabolic abnormalities associated with these changes in body composition. Clinical outcomes include but are not limited to increased risk of fractures, impaired functional status (including activities of daily living), physical disability, insulin resistance, increased risk of infections, increased length of hospital stay, and reduced survival. These health outcomes are likely to be worse when compared to individuals with obesity, sarcopenia, or osteopenia/osteoporosis alone. Interventions that utilize resistance training exercise in conjunction with increased protein intake appear to be promising in their ability to counteract osteosarcopenic obesity.},

abstract = {Objective: In addition to the waist circumference (WC) measurement, an accurate measurement of visceral fat is very important in terms of the pathology associated with the metabolic syndrome. The only method available for an accurate measurement of a visceral fat area (VFA) is abdominal computed tomography (CT). To overcome this limitation, we estimated VFA using abdominal bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with accuracy comparable to that of abdominal CT, and investigated the relationship between VFA and risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. Because abdominal BIA detects excess visceral fat accumulation that cannot be detected by a measurement of WC, the characteristics of the subjects who were identified as having excessive visceral fat using BIA, but not WC, were examined. Methods: Abdominal BIA was used to estimate VFA in male subjects (n = 1803) (age: 48 ± 10 years, body mass index: 23.9 ± 3.0 kg/m2) who provided informed consent. Results: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome diagnosed based on the diagnostic criteria established by the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine was 18{\%}. Among the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, WC was significantly correlated with triglycerides (TG), but estimated VFA was correlated with blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), in addition to TG. Abdominal BIA detected excess visceral fat accumulation in 3{\%} of subjects for whom WC had detected none. Elevated blood pressure, TG, and fasting plasma glucose and decreased HDL-C were also noted in these subjects, and the values of these risk factors were comparable to those of subjects in whom visceral fat accumulation was detected using WC. Conclusion: Abdominal BIA is a simple and safe method that is superior to WC for the detection of excessive visceral fat accumulation. Therefore, abdominal BIA will likely be used clinically to detect excessive accumulation of visceral fat, which is an important predictor of the metabolic syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2008 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Sedentary behaviors have recently become an important public health issue. We aimed to investigate the relationship between screen time and nutrient intake in children and adolescents. METHODS The present study was conducted in 2013. Data were collected from children and adolescents aged between 6 and 15 years old in Shika town. Questionnaires were distributed to 1459 subjects, 1414 of whom participated in the study (96.9{\%}). Sedentary behaviors were assessed based on participants' screen behaviors (television (TV) viewing, personal computer (PC) use, and mobile phone (MP) use). The main outcomes were the intake of nutrients from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the significance of differences in nutrient intake estimates. Multivariate linear regression analyses, adjusting for age, BMI, and physical activity, were used to provide parameter estimates ($\beta$) and 95{\%} CI for the relationship between screen time and nutrient intake. RESULTS In boys, longer TV viewing times correlated or tended to correlate with a lower intake of protein, potassium, calcium, iron, vitamin K, vitamin B-2, and total dietary fiber. In girls, longer TV viewing times correlated with a lower intake of protein, sodium, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B-2. Longer TV viewing times correlated with a higher intake of n-6 fatty acids in girls. PC use was related or tended to be related to a lower intake of potassium, iron, vitamin K, and folic acid in boys, but not in girls. A relationship was observed between MP use and a lower intake of vitamin K in boys, and MP use and a higher intake of vitamin D in girls. CONCLUSIONS The present results revealed that longer TV viewing times are associated with less protein, minerals, vitamins, and total dietary fiber intake in children and adolescents. It was also revealed that boys with PC use have less minerals and vitamins. These results support the need to design intervention programs that focus on decreasing TV viewing time in both sexes and PC use in boys while encouraging adherence to dietary guidelines among children and adolescents.},

abstract = {The importance of the circadian rhythm in regulating human food intake behaviour and metabolism has long been recognised. However, little is known as to how energy intake is distributed over the day in existing populations, and its potential association with obesity. The present review describes global trends in time-of-day of energy intake in the general population based on data from cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal cohorts. Evidence of the association between time-of-day of energy intake and obesity is also summarised. Overall, there were a limited number of cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal cohorts that provided data on time-of-day of energy intake. In the identified studies, a wide variation in time-of-day of energy intake was observed, with patterns of energy distribution varying greatly by country and geographical area. In relation to obesity, eight cross-sectional surveys and two longitudinal cohorts were identified. The association between time-of-day of energy intake and obesity varied widely, with several studies reporting a positive link between evening energy intake and obesity. In conclusion, the current review summarises global trends in time-of-day of energy intake. The large variations across countries and global regions could have important implications to health, emphasising the need to understand the socio-environmental factors guiding such differences in eating patterns. Evidence of the association between time-of-day of energy intake and BMI also varied. Further larger scale collaborations between various countries and regions are needed to sum data from existing surveys and cohorts, and guide our understanding of the role of chrono-nutrition in health.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Decline in the number of teeth and physical fitness begins from 40 years of age; however, several epidemiological studies have identified relationships between oral conditions and physical performance parameters in community-dwelling elderly population. The aim of this study was to validate the relationship between the muscle mass and its function and oral conditions (number of teeth and dental occlusion) after 40 years of age in a community-dwelling population in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS The subjects comprised of 552 volunteers (198 males and 354 females, 40-79 years) who participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in 2013. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed with the measures of the muscle mass and its function as objective variables and the measures of the number of teeth, age, body mass index, medical history, serum albumin concentration, smoking status, habitual alcohol intake, marital status, education levels, and exercising habits as explanatory variables. The relationships between the Eichner index and the muscle mass and its function were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS After adjusting for confounding factors, the number of teeth was shown to be an independent risk factor for the timed 10 m walk test (in females) and the skeletal muscle mass of the whole body (in males). The results also revealed that the timed 10 m walk test was significantly correlated with the Eichner index (Classes A and C in females were correlated). CONCLUSION This cross-sectional study on a Japanese community-dwelling population revealed relationships between oral conditions and the muscle mass and its function. However, the interpretation of our results was hampered by a lack of data, including those on socioeconomic status and longitudinal observations. Future research exploring teeth loss and the muscle mass and its function is warranted.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis can be considered a multilevel statistical problem, since information within studies is combined in the presence of potential heterogeneity between studies. Here a general multilevel model framework is developed for meta-analysis to combine either summary data or individual patient outcome data from each study, and to include either study or individual level covariates that might explain heterogeneity. Classical and Bayesian approaches to estimation are contrasted. These methods are applied to a meta-analysis of trials of thrombolytic therapy after myocardial infarction. Subgroups within the trials were available, categorized by the time delay until treatment, so that a three-level random effects model that includes time delay as a covariate is proposed. In addition it was desired to represent the treatment effect as an absolute risk reduction, rather than the conventional odds ratio. We show how this can be achieved within a Bayesian analysis, while still recognizing the binary nature of the original outcome data.},

abstract = {Body weight and obesity show familial resemblance that could be the result of familial correlation of fat oxidation, low levels of which have been implicated in the etiology of weight gain and obesity. We studied the familial correlation of both 24-h respiratory quotient (RQ), an index of the ratio of fat to carbohydrate oxidation, and the possible influence of dietary macronutrient composition expressed by the food quotient (FQ), i.e. the theoretical RQ produced by the diet. We measured the habitual FQ of the 7 days diet by weighed food records, followed by measurement of 24-h RQ in respiration chambers in 71 healthy Caucasian siblings from 31 families. After adjustment for age, gender, and 24-h energy balance, 24-h RQ correlated in families as indicated by an intraclass correlation coefficient (r(i)) of 0.31 (P = 0.03). FQ, adjusted for age and gender, was also a familial trait for the two days immediately preceding diet (r(i) = 0.32, P {\textless} 0.01). The familial effect on 24-h RQ, adjusted for age, gender, and 24-h energy balance, remained after adjustment for the FQ of the two days preceding diet (r(i) = 0.27, P {\textless} 0.05) and was reduced but not abolished after further adjustment for fasting plasma insulin plus free fatty acids (r(i) = 0.24, P {\textless} 0.09). By a correlation analysis aimed at separating familial and individual nonfamilial factors influencing both 24-h RQ and FQ, we found a great but insignificant familial (etaF = 0.49, P {\textless} 0.18) and a somewhat lower, but significant individual nonfamilial correlation (etaNF = 0.35, P {\textless} 0.03). We conclude that substrate oxidation rates measured by RQ exhibit familial correlation after proper adjustment for confounders such as energy balance, gender, and age, and that this effect could not be fully explained by preceding diet composition, fasting plasma insulin, and free fatty acids. Further RQ and the habitual dietary composition shared familial and nonfamilial factors.},

abstract = {AIMS Sarcopenia measured as appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and central obesity measured as visceral fat area (VFA) may act synergistically to influence metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. However, several previous studies reported that metabolic risk is higher in non-sarcopenic obesity groups than in sarcopenic obesity groups because of the close relationship between muscle mass and body fat. We investigated the association of the ASM to VFA ratio, which we have termed the muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR), with metabolic syndrome and arterial stiffness. METHODS This study was performed in 526 apparently healthy adults enrolled in the Korean Sarcopenic Obesity Study, an ongoing prospective observational cohort study. ASM was evaluated with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and VFA with computed tomography. Arterial stiffness was measured using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). RESULTS MFR was significantly associated with waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profiles, glucose and baPWV. By multiple logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for metabolic syndrome was 5.43 (lowest versus highest tertile of MFR, 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.56-13.34). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that MFR was an independent determinant of baPWV (R²=0.57). CONCLUSIONS MFR, a new index of sarcopenic obesity, showed an independent negative association with metabolic syndrome and arterial stiffness.},

abstract = {The bio-impedance technique appears appropriate for non-invasive cardiac stroke volume (SV) measurement, as the thoracic conductivity distribution is altered during the cardiac cycle due to the heart contraction and blood perfusion. In the present work, the feasibility of a parametric electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for assessing the cardiac SV was studied. An impedance model of the thorax was constructed from segmented axial MRI images along 19 phases of the cardiac cycle. The heart was simulated as an ellipsoid, with its axes' lengths set as the reconstruction parameters, while all other tissues' geometry and conductivity values were kept fixed. A Newton-Raphson parametric optimization scheme was utilized, yielding a correlation between the reconstructed and anatomical left ventricular volumes of 0.97 (p = 2 x 10(-11)). An analysis of noise sensitivity showed that the proposed algorithm requires an SNR greater than 65 dB. The simulation results were compared to physical data, collected with a portable EIT system (PulmoTrace, CardioInspect). The validation study was employed for a group of N = 28 healthy patients, and a comparison with impedance cardiography measurements (BioZ, Cardiodynamics) was made, showing a correlation of r = 0.86 (p = 4 x10(-9)). The preliminary results demonstrate that parametric EIT has the potential to measure SV, and may be applicable for both clinical and home environment usage.},

abstract = {The metabolic syndrome is a set of risk factors that include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It has affected around 25{\%} of adults in the US and become a serious problem in Asian countries recently due to the change in dietary habit and life style. On the other hand, Bayesian networks that are the models to solve the problems of uncertainty provide a robust and transparent formalism for probabilistic modeling, so they have been used as a method for diagnostic or prognostic model in medical domain. Since the K2 algorithm, a well-known algorithm for Bayesian networks structure learning, is influenced by an input order of the attributes, an optimization of BN attribute ordering has been studied as a research issue. This paper proposes a novel ordering optimization method using a genetic algorithm based on medical expert knowledge in order to solve this problem. For experiments, we use the dataset examined twice in 1993 and 1995 in Yonchon County of Korea. It has 18 attributes of 1193 subjects participated in both surveys. Using this dataset, we make the prognostic model of the metabolic syndrome using Bayesian networks with an optimized ordering by evolutionary approach. Through an ordering optimization, the prognostic model of higher performance is constructed, and the optimized Bayesian network model by the proposed method outperforms the conventional BN model as well as neural networks and k-nearest neighbors. Finally, we present the application program using the prognostic model of the metabolic syndrome in order to show the usefulness of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a badly posed inverse problem, but can be stabilized if one assumes that the conductivity is piecewise constant, with a relatively small number of distinct regions, and that the region boundaries are known, for example from prior anatomical imaging. With this assumption, we introduce a three-dimensional (3-D) boundary element method (BEM) model for the forward EIT map from injected currents to measured voltages, and 3-D inverse solutions for both BEM and the finite element method (FEM) which explicitly take into account the parameterization implied by the known boundary locations. We develop expressions for the Jacobians for both methods, since they are nonlinear, to more rapidly solve the inverse problem. We show simulation results in a torso geometry with the heart and lungs as inhomogeneities. In a simulation study, we could reconstruct the conductive values of some internal organs of a human torso with more than 92{\%} accuracy even with inaccurate internal boundary locations, a randomized rather than constant conductivity profile (with the standard deviation of the Gaussian-distributed conductivities set to 20{\%} of their mean values), signal to measurement noise of 50 dB, and with different meshes used for the forward and inverse problems. BEM and FEM perform similarly, leading to the conclusion that the choice between them should be based on secondary considerations such as computational efficiency or the need to model conductivity anisotropies.},

abstract = {Objectives: (1) To develop a fully automated algorithm for segmentation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), excluding intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) and bone marrow (BM), from axial abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. (2) To evaluate the algorithm accuracy and total method reproducibility using a semi-automatically segmented reference and data from repeated measurements. Background: MRI is a widely used in adipose tissue (AT) assessment. Manual analysis of MRI data is time consuming and biased by the operator. Automated analysis spares resources and increase reproducibility. Fully automated algorithms have been presented. However, reproducibility analysis has not been performed nor has methods for exclusion of IMAT and BM been presented. Methods: In total, 49 data sets from 31 subjects were acquired using a clinical 1.5 T MRI scanner. Thirteen data sets were used in the derivation of the automated algorithm and 36 were used in the validation. Common image analysis tools such as thresholding, morphological operations and geometrical models were used to segment VAT and SAT. Accuracy was assessed using a semi-automatically created reference. Reproducibility was assessed from repeated measurements. Results: Resulting AT volumes from the automated analysis and the reference were not found to differ significantly (2.0714{\%} and 0.8472.7{\%}, given as mean7s.d., for VAT and SAT, respectively). The automated analysis of the repeated measurements data significantly increased the reproducibility of the VAT measurements. One athletic subject with very small amounts of AT was considered to be an outlier. Conclusions: An automated method for segmentation of VAT and SAT and exclusion of IMAT and BM from abdominal MRI data has been reported. The accuracy and reproducibility of the method has also been demonstrated using a semi-automatically segmented reference and analysis of repeated acquisitions. The accuracy of the method is limited in lean subjects.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in two noninvasive transcranial neuroimaging techniques, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), signify the increasing importance of establishing structural compatibility between transcranial methods and conventional tomographic methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The transcranial data obtained from the head surface should be projected onto the cortical surface to present the transcranial brain-mapping data on the same platform as tomographic methods. Thus, we developed two transcranial projection algorithms that project given head-surface points onto the cortical surface in structural images, and computer programs based on them. The convex-hull algorithm features geometric handling of the cortical surface, while the balloon-inflation algorithm is faster, and better reflects the local cortical structure. The automatic cortical projection methods proved to be as effective as the manual projection method described in our previous study. These methods achieved perfect correspondence between any given point on the head surface or a related nearby point in space, and its cortical projection point. Moreover, we developed a neighbor-reference method that enables transcranial cortical projection of a given head-surface point in reference to three neighboring points and one additional standard point, even when no structural image of the subject is available. We also calculated an error factor associated with these probabilistic estimations. The current study presents a close topological link between transcranial and tomographic brain-mapping modalities, which could contribute to inter-modal data standardization. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a non-invasive method of studying brain mechanisms involved in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation in humans by using visual food cues that are relevant to individuals attempting weight loss. DESIGN: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain activation in regions of interest between groups of food photographs. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy, non-obese women who were not dieting for weight loss. MEASUREMENTS: Independent raters viewed food photographs and evaluated whether the foods depicted should be eaten by individuals attempting a calorically-restricted diet. Based on their responses, we categorized photographs into 'non-fattening' and 'fattening' food groups, the latter characterized by high-caloric content and usually also high-fat or high-sugar content. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response was measured by fMRI while participants viewed photographs of 'fattening' food, 'non-fattening' food, and non-food objects. RESULTS: Viewing photographs of fattening food compared with non-food objects resulted in significantly greater activation in the brainstem; hypothalamus; left amygdala; left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; left orbitofrontal cortex; right insular cortex; bilateral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and putamen; bilateral thalamus; and occipital lobe. By comparison, only the occipital region had greater activation by non-fattening food than by object photographs. Combining responses to all food types resulted in attenuation of activation in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and striatum. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that, in non-obese women, neural circuits engaged in energy homeostasis and reward processing are selectively attuned to representations of high-calorie foods that are perceived as fattening. Studies to investigate hormonal action or manipulation of energy balance may benefit from fMRI protocols that contrast energy-rich food stimuli with non-food or low-calorie food stimuli.},

This individual participant data（IPD）meta-analysis was to assess the overall effect of tea catechin supplementation（tea catechins rich beverage）on Japanese healthy adults. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data（IPD）from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Data sources Medline（PubMed）, JDream Ⅲ and University hospital Medical Information Network （UMIN）Clinical Trials Registry from inception to January 2018. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials of ingestion of tea catechins（tea catechins rich beverage）for 12 or more weeks were eligible for inclusion if data of body fat or visceral fat were collect and if participants were Japanese adults. Results Seven eligible randomized controlled trials（total 1052 participants）were identified. IPD were obtained for 1049 participants. Tea catechins reduced abdominal visceral fat area （－8.83 cm2; 95％ confidence interval －11.14 to －6.52）, abdominal subcutaneous fat area （－11.45 cm2; 95％ confidence interval －14.34 to －8.55）, and abdominal total fat area （－20.66 cm2; 95％ confidence interval －24.71 to －16.61）. Adverse effects caused by tea catechins were not observed. Conclusions Tea catechins have body fat and visceral fat reducing effects in Japanese healthy adults.},

abstract = {Obesity is a serious and growing public health problem in the United States and the world. The pathophysiological processes that underlie the increasing prevalence of obesity have not been clearly defined but likely involve faulty interactions between environmental factors, which favor positive energy balance, and weight regulatory systems in genetically susceptible individuals. Individuals who are genetically predisposed to thinness in the current environment may be able to sense and respond to excess energy intake more rapidly and accurately than those predisposed to obesity. The regulation of energy intake and therefore the potential adaptation to changes in energy balance is a complex process with interactions between homeostatic and non-homeostatic signals likely being critical. We have observed that thin (obese-resistant) individuals quickly sense changes in positive energy balance with not only changes in measures of appetite but also in brain regions important for the regulation of energy intake. This is in contrast to reduced-obese (obese-prone) individuals who do not appear to appropriately sense the changes in positive energy balance, suggesting that there is a differential sensitivity to positive energy balance between obese-resistant and obese-prone individuals. We have also found evidence for important interactions between external food cues and activation of brain regions important in the homeostatic regulation of energy balance. These findings emphasize the important role of environmental visual cues and suggest that there are important phenotypic differences in the interactions between external visual sensory inputs, energy balance status, and brain regions important in the regulation of energy intake. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The act of tasting is the product of inseparable integrative behavior consisting of multi-sensory processing and orolingual motor coordination. Often tasting-induced brain activity is looked at in a reductionist manner as a set of isolated components. However, brain activity as a whole during tasting may not simply be the sum of isolated brain responses; therefore, attempting to look at the cortical activation in a more holistic manner is important. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we assessed cortical responses during tasting, contrasting observed neuronal activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), of 19 healthy participants before and during tasting of 8 ml of sweet-based solutions. To examine the activated brain structure, we estimated the anatomical regions of the measured location in standard brain space. We also included simple tongue tapping movement (TT) and word fluency (WF) tasks as comparative functional markers. Significant activity was found in channels (CHs) estimated to be in the bilateral oral motor areas during the TT task, and those in the LPFC, primarily in the left hemisphere, during the WF task. During the tasting task, significant activation was observed in CHs estimated to lie in the ventral part of pre- and post-central gyri as well as in the ventro-LPFC (VLPFC). The activated regions partly overlapped with those detected during TT or WF tasks, but extended more anteriorly and ventrally. Our study suggests that, in addition to tongue motor areas, the VLPFC is involved in the act of tasting. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigated BMI trajectory patterns before diabetes diagnosis and examined associated changes in visceral adiposity and glucose metabolism. 23,978 non-diabetic Japanese participants (2,789 women) aged 30-64 years were assessed with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years. Diabetes was diagnosed via fasting glucose, HbA1c, and self-report. Latent-class trajectory analyses were performed to identify BMI trajectories. Longitudinal changes in BMI, visceral adiposity, and glucose metabolism were estimated using mixed models. 1,892 individuals developed diabetes. Three distinct BMI trajectories were identified in adults developing and not developing diabetes, respectively. Among adults developing diabetes, 47.3{\%} were classified as "medium BMI" (n = 895), and had increased mean BMI within the obesity category before diagnosis. The "low BMI" group (38.4{\%}, n = 726) had an initial mean BMI of 21.9 kg/m2, and demonstrated small weight gain. The "high BMI" group (n = 271) were severely obese and showed greater increase in BMI until diagnosis. All groups which developed diabetes showed absolute and/or relative increase in visceral fat and impaired $\beta$-cell compensation for insulin resistance. All groups not developing diabetes showed measured variables were relatively stable during observation. These data suggest that visceral fat gain may induce $\beta$-cell failure in compensation for insulin resistance, resulting in diabetes regardless of obesity level.},

abstract = {Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a member of an emerging CCN gene family that is implicated in various diseases associated with fibro-proliferative disorder including scleroderma and atherosclerosis. The function of CTGF in human cancer is largely unknown. We now show that CTGF induces apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. CTGF mRNA was completely absent in MCF-7 but strongly induced by treatment with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta by itself induced apoptosis in MCF-7, and this effect was reversed by co-treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide. Overexpression of CTGF gene in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells significantly augmented apoptosis. Moreover, recombinant CTGF protein significantly enhanced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as evaluated by DNA fragmentation, Tdt-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling staining, flow cytometry analysis, and nuclear staining using Hoechst 33258. Finally, recombinant CTGF showed no effect on Bax protein expression but significantly reduced Bcl2 protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that CTGF is a major inducer of apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and that TGF-beta-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is mediated, in part, by CTGF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fat mass is thought to be protective against osteoporosis, primarily because of its weight-bearing effect. Few studies have evaluated the association between abdominal fat mass (AFM) and bone health beyond its weight-bearing effect. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that higher body weight-adjusted AFM is associated with poor bone health. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 629 Puerto Rican adults aged 47-79 y. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck, trochanter, total femur, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) were measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). AFM and total fat mass (TFM) were assessed by using body-composition software from whole-body DXA scans. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as T-scores {\textless}/= -2.5 and -1.0 to -2.5 SD, respectively, at the respective bone site. RESULTS: After confounders were controlled for, body weight-adjusted AFM was inversely associated with BMD at all 4 bone sites in women and at the femoral neck in men. For TFM, small inverse associations were seen at the trochanter and total femur in women. In men, similar associations were seen at the 3 femur sites. In both sexes, the odds for osteoporosis or osteopenia at each of the femoral sites increased by 10-16{\%} for every 100-g increase in body weight-adjusted AFM. CONCLUSIONS: Higher AFM was associated with poor bone health in this Puerto Rican sample. Efforts to reduce abdominal obesity will not only reduce the risk of chronic disease but may also improve bone health. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There is a recognized need to determine influenza vaccine effectiveness on an annual basis and a long history of studying respiratory illnesses in households. METHODS We recruited 328 households with 1441 members, including 839 children, and followed them during the 2010-2011 influenza season. Specimens were collected from subjects with reported acute respiratory illnesses and tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receipt of influenza vaccine was defined based on documented evidence of vaccination in medical records or an immunization registry. The effectiveness of 2010-2011 influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and presence of high-risk condition, and stratified by prior season (2009-2010) vaccination status. RESULTS Influenza was identified in 78 (24{\%}) households and 125 (9{\%}) individuals; the infection risk was 8.5{\%} in the vaccinated and 8.9{\%} in the unvaccinated (P = .83). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness in preventing community-acquired influenza was 31{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -7{\%} to 55{\%}). In vaccinated subjects with no evidence of prior season vaccination, significant protection (62{\%} [95{\%} CI, 17{\%}-82{\%}]) against community-acquired influenza was demonstrated. Substantially lower effectiveness was noted among subjects who were vaccinated in both the current and prior season. There was no evidence that vaccination prevented household transmission once influenza was introduced; adults were at particular risk despite vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Vaccine effectiveness estimates were lower than those demonstrated in other observational studies carried out during the same season. The unexpected findings of lower effectiveness with repeated vaccination and no protection given household exposure require further study.},

Alpha band signals in a narrow frequency window around the spectral peak of individual subjects were wavelet analyzed and phase-locked component to the stimulus onset was obtained as a complex number. The amplitude of the phase-locked component was averaged during 0-1 s after stimulus onset for 30 epochs in a measurement session and across 76 channels of MEG sensor. In statistical test of individual subjects, significant difference was found in the real part of the averaged phase-locked amplitude between the normal-color and reverse-color pictures. These results suggest that affective information processing of food pictures is reflected in the synchronized component of narrow band alpha rhythm.},

SETTING Adult Greek population. SUBJECTS METHODS: Follow-up was performed from 1993 to 2003 in the context of the Greek component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition. Participants were 22 944 healthy adults, whose diet was assessed through a validated questionnaire. Participants were distributed by increasing deciles according to protein intake or carbohydrate intake, as well as by an additive score generated by increasing decile intake of protein and decreasing decile intake of carbohydrates. Proportional hazards regression was used to assess the relation between high protein, high carbohydrate and the low carbohydrate-high protein score on the one hand and mortality on the other. RESULTS During 113 230 persons years of follow-up, there were 455 deaths. In models with energy adjustment, higher intake of carbohydrates was associated with significant reduction of total mortality, whereas higher intake of protein was associated with nonsignificant increase of total mortality (per decile, mortality ratios 0.94 with 95{\%} CI 0.89 -0.99, and 1.02 with 95{\%} CI 0.98 -1.07 respectively). Even more predictive of higher mortality were high values of the additive low carbohydrate-high protein score (per 5 units, mortality ratio 1.22 with 95{\%} CI 1.09 -to 1.36). Positive associations of this score were noted with respect to both cardiovascular and cancer mortality. CONCLUSION Prolonged consumption of diets low in carbohydrates and high in protein is associated with an increase in total mortality.},

A number of anorexigenic and orexigenic molecules in the hypothalamic nuclei participate in the control of energy homeostasis. Leptin and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone are key anorectic molecules, and the leptin receptor and POMC gene are both expressed in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Although it has been considered that melanocortin signaling is localized downstream to leptin signaling, data have accumulated to support the concept of a leptin-independent melanocortin signaling system. We focus on and review the melanocortin signaling system that functions dependently or independently of leptin signaling in the regulation of energy homeostasis.},

The current study examines the distributed representation of an important but under-explored category, foods. Participants viewed pictures of appetizing foods (along with pictures of locations for comparison) during event-related fMRI. Compared to location pictures, food pictures activated the right insula/operculum and the left orbitofrontal cortex, both gustatory processing areas. Food pictures also activated regions of visual cortex that represent object shape. Together these areas contribute to a distributed neural circuit that represents food knowledge. Not only does this circuit become active during the tasting of actual foods, it also becomes active while viewing food pictures. Via the process of pattern completion, food pictures activate gustatory regions of the circuit to produce conceptual inferences about taste. Consistent with theories that ground knowledge in the modalities, these inferences arise as reenactments of modality-specific processing.},

To exemplify the methods, we use the results from 22$\backslash$ntrials to prevent respiratory tract infections; we also make comparisons$\backslash$nwith a second example data set comprising fewer trials. Within summary$\backslash$ndata methods, confidence intervals for the overall treatment effect$\backslash$nand for the between-trial variance may be derived from likelihood$\backslash$nbased methods or a parametric bootstrap as well as from Wald methods;$\backslash$nthe bootstrap intervals are preferred because they relax the assumptions$\backslash$nrequired by the other two methods. When modelling individual patient$\backslash$ndata, a bias corrected bootstrap may be used to provide unbiased$\backslash$nestimation and correctly located confidence intervals; this method$\backslash$nis particularly valuable for the between-trial variance. The trial$\backslash$neffects may be modelled as either fixed or random within individual$\backslash$ndata models, and we discuss the corresponding assumptions and implications.$\backslash$nIf random trial effects are used, the covariance between these and$\backslash$nthe random treatment effects should be included; the resulting model$\backslash$nis equivalent to a bivariate approach to meta-analysis. Having implemented$\backslash$nthese techniques, the flexibility of multilevel modelling may be$\backslash$nexploited in facilitating extensions to standard meta-analysis methods.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging modality, where imperceptible currents are applied to the skin and the resulting surface voltages are measured. It has the potential to distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke with a portable and inexpensive device. The image reconstruction relies on an accurate forward model of the experimental setup. Because of the relatively small signal in stroke EIT, the finite element modelling requires meshes of more than 10 million elements. To study the requirements in the forward modelling in EIT and also to reduce the time for experimental image acquisition it is necessary to reduce the run time of the forward computation. We show the implementation of a parallel forward solver for EIT using the DUNE-FEM C++ library and demonstrate its performance on many CPU's of a computer cluster. For a typical EIT application a direct solver was significantly slower and not an alternative to iterative solvers with multigrid preconditioning. With this new solver we can compute the forward solutions and the Jacobian matrix of a typical EIT application with 30 electrodes on a 15 million element mesh in less than 15 minutes. This makes it a valuable tool for simulation studies and EIT applications with high precision requirements. It is freely available for download.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although an important secondary prevention trial reported an impressive protection by a Mediterranean dietary pattern on reinfarction and cardiovascular death, scarce direct epidemiologic evidence is currently available regarding the role of the Mediterranean diet in the aetiology of coronary heart disease. AIMS: The aim of the study was to quantify the risk reduction of incident myocardial infarction provided by a Mediterranean dietary pattern. METHODS: We included 342 subjects (171 patients who suffered their first acute myocardial infarction and 171 matched controls) in a case-control study. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (136 items) was used. We defined an a priori Mediterranean dietary pattern. We assessed six food items that we considered protective: 1) olive oil, 2) fiber, 3) fruits, 4)vegetables, 5) fish and 6) alcohol. For each of these six dietary factors, we calculated the distribution according to quintiles within the study and assigned each participant a score of 1 to 5 corresponding to the quintile of intake, with 1 representing the lowest and 5 representing the highest quintile. We also estimated the quintiles of two other elements assumed to be associated with a higher risk: 7) meat/meat products and 8) some items with high glycaemic load (white bread, pasta and rice). For these two elements we inversely ranked the score, with 1 representing the highest and 5 representing the lowest quintile. Finally, we summed up the eight quintile values for each participant.A second score ( post hoc pattern) was built using only a single cut-off point for these eight elements. The cut-off points for each element in this post hoc pattern were decided according to the dose-response relationships between the consumption of each food item and the risk of myocardial infarction observed in the analyses that used quintiles of each food item. RESULTS: For both patterns, we found that the higher the score, the lower the odds ratio of myocardial infarction. A significant linear trend was apparent after adjustment for the main cardiovascular risk factors. For each additional point in the a priori Mediterranean pattern (observed range: 9-38) the odds ratio (95 {\%} confidence intervals) was 0.92 (0.86-0.98). This estimate was 0.55 (0.42-0.73) when we used the post hoc pattern (range: 0-8). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that a Mediterranean diet (that emphasizes olive oil, fiber, fruits, vegetables, fish and alcohol and reduces meat/meat products) can be an effective measure for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction. However, our results support the exclusion of refined cereals with a high glycaemic load as healthy elements of this pattern.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the longitudinal association between serial biomarker measures of circulating omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n3-PUFA) levels and healthy ageing. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Four communities in the United States (Cardiovascular Health Study) from 1992 to 2015. PARTICIPANTS 2622 adults with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (4.8) and with successful healthy ageing at baseline in 1992-93. EXPOSURE Cumulative levels of plasma phospholipid n3-PUFAs were measured using gas chromatography in 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06, expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, including $\alpha$-linolenic acid from plants and eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid from seafoood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Healthy ageing defined as survival without chronic diseases (ie, cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease, and severe chronic kidney disease), the absence of cognitive and physical dysfunction, or death from other causes not part of the healthy ageing outcome after age 65. Events were centrally adjudicated or determined from medical records and diagnostic tests. RESULTS Higher levels of long chain n3-PUFAs were associated with an 18{\%} lower risk (95{\%} confidence interval 7{\%} to 28{\%}) of unhealthy ageing per interquintile range after multivariable adjustments with time-varying exposure and covariates. Individually, higher eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid) levels were associated with a lower risk: 15{\%} (6{\%} to 23{\%}) and 16{\%} (6{\%} to 25{\%}), respectively. $\alpha$-linolenic acid from plants was not noticeably associated with unhealthy ageing (hazard ratio 0.92, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.83 to 1.02). CONCLUSIONS In older adults, a higher cumulative level of serially measured circulating n3-PUFAs from seafood (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid from seafood or $\alpha$-linolenic acid from plants) was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy ageing. These findings support guidelines for increased dietary consumption of n3-PUFAs in older adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence linking selective migration (the situation where people in good health move from deprived to affluent areas, whilst people in poor health move in the opposite direction) within local areas to mortality is inconclusive. METHODS: Mortality in within-city migrants was examined using a Sheffield population cohort, adjusted for moves to care homes. The cohort comprised 310 894 people aged 25+ years in 2001 followed up for 9.18 years, with 42 252 (13.6{\%}) deaths. Information on pre-existing medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators and smoking was available from a sample survey. RESULTS: Relative risks (95{\%} CI) of mortality in migrants from deprived to affluent areas were lower compared with people remaining in deprived areas; 0.53 (0.42 to 0.65), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.80), 0.76 (0.68 to 0.86), 0.93 (0.88 to 1.00) and 0.98 (0.93 to 1.03) in the 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ year age bands, respectively. They also had lower prevalence ORs (95{\%} CI) for bronchitis (0.59 (0.39 to 0.89)), asthma (0.70 (0.53 to 0.93)), depression (0.59 (0.38 to 0.94)), and were less likely to receive benefits (0.60 (0.47 to 0.76)) and less likely to smoke (0.66 (0.51 to 0.85)).Conversely, mortality relative risks in migrants from affluent to deprived areas were higher compared with people remaining in affluent areas; 1.71 (1.37 to 2.12), 1.59 (1.40 to 1.82), 1.44 (1.26 to 1.63), 1.18 (1.10 to 1.27) and 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09) in the corresponding age groups. They also had higher prevalence odds ratios for long-term illness (2.37 (1.71 to 3.29)), asthma (1.71 (1.25 to 2.35)), diabetes (3.03 (1.70 to 5.41)), depression (2.71 (1.74 to 4.21)), were more likely to receive benefits (2.25 (1.65 to 3.07)) and more likely to smoke (1.51 (1.12 to 2.05)). CONCLUSIONS: People moving from deprived to affluent areas had lower mortality and better health, and vice versa, especially in the younger age groups. This study provides strong evidence linking selective migration within local areas to mortality.},

abstract = {Aim: To develop tools for predicting diabetes development in middle-aged Chinese adults living in Taiwan. Methods: This study made use of data from 24,899 non-diabetic adults aged ≥35 years who received health examination service from a private health check-up clinic during the period of 1994-1996 and had one or more examinations before December 31, 2006. The proportional hazard model and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method were used respectively to construct the prediction equation and assess the model's performance. A point system is developed for the ease to calculate diabetes risk. Results: Increased risk of diabetes development was associated with older age, lower education level, alcohol abstinence, abdominal obesity, elevated body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), triglycerides, and impaired fasting glucose. Model 1, incorporating personal socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, BMI, and waist circumference (WC), had an area-under-curve (AUC) of 0.717. The AUC increased to 0.726 (model 2) when BP was introduced and to 0.823 (model 3) when both BP and clinical chemistry measures were added. The AUCs in the testing set for models 1, 2, and 3 were 0.688, 0.694, and 0.799 respectively. Conclusions: These predictive equations of diabetic risk were easy to use by clinical professions and general subjects. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The purpose of this study, employing electromyography, was to examine the neuromuscular changes that occur with menthol applied to the skin over the quadriceps muscle. METHODS Forty-two healthy volunteers performed isometric knee extensions at 35{\%} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in three groups (Adult Placebo, Adult Menthol, Older Adult Menthol). Stimulation used was application of 5{\%} menthol gel to the skin. Surface electromyography (sEMG) from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and rectus femoris (RF) was recorded using miniature pair electrodes. RESULTS Root mean square electromyography (rmsEMG) in VL and VM significantly increased with menthol stimulation both in Adult and Older Adult, but no significant difference was observed between Adult Menthol and Older Adult Menthol. There was a significant decrease in mean power frequency (MPF) in VM with menthol stimulation in Older Adult, but no significant changes were observed in Adult Menthol. CONCLUSION Neuromuscular modulation was observed with the application of menthol gel at low loads in the present study. These findings could lead to a new method of muscular training that targets the recruitment of fast type muscle safe for older adults.},

The STYLIST study examined the effects of dietary counseling by registered dietitians and the delivery of proper calorie-controlled meals (UMIN Registration No: 000006582). METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-hundred adult patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus were randomly divided into 2 groups with/without dietary counseling and consumed an ordinary diet for 4 weeks. Each group was then subdivided into 2 groups with/without dietary counseling and received calorie-controlled lunch and dinner boxes for the next 4 weeks. The calories in the delivered meals were based on the subject's ideal body weight (BW) and physical activity level. BW, waist circumference, blood pressure, and laboratory data, including glycoalbumin, were measured at 0, 4, and 8 weeks. BW and the other parameters were significantly reduced during the study period in patients who received diet counseling in the ordinary diet period and/or delivered meal period but not in patients without dietary counseling, as assessed by linear mixed models for longitudinal data. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of dietary counseling by dietitians and delivery of calorie-controlled meals was effective in reducing BW, as well as blood pressure and glycoalbumin, in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify intercountry food intake patterns, we compared the household food availability data collected by the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) in the United States and the Household Budget Surveys (HBS) from 10 European countries that participated in the DAta Food NEtworking (DAFNE) project, namely Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. METHODOLOGY: The DAFNE project harmonized European household food availability data by clarifying which food items were included in each country's HBS, and then defining comparable food categories among countries. NFCS household data were harmonized with the HBS data by applying the same procedures used in the DAFNE project. RESULTS: The results presented in this paper reveal a number of similarities and differences in household food availability among 11 nations. In nearly all countries studied, red meat was available in greater quantities than poultry and seafood combined. Most countries favoured bread and rolls over other types of grain products, had a low to moderate availability of seafood and legumes, had a moderate amount of sugar available, and consumed approximately two-thirds or more of fruits and vegetables in a fresh form. Milk availability tended to be inversely correlated with cheese availability. Only in Mediterranean households was vegetable oil, namely olive oil, the primary type of added lipid available. While the data presented in this paper can do much to improve our understanding of food availability in US and European households, it is important to remember that these data do not include foods purchased and consumed away from home. APPLICATIONS: Despite the limitations of household food availability data, the results presented in this paper can help health professionals develop a more international perspective.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging modality, where imperceptible currents are applied to the skin and the resulting surface voltages are measured. It has the potential to distinguish between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke with a portable and inexpensive device. The image reconstruction relies on an accurate forward model of the experimental setup. Because of the relatively small signal in stroke EIT, the finite element modelling requires meshes of more than 10 million elements. To study the requirements in the forward modelling in EIT and also to reduce the time for experimental image acquisition it is necessary to reduce the run time of the forward computation. We show the implementation of a parallel forward solver for EIT using the DUNE-FEM C++ library and demonstrate its performance on many CPU's of a computer cluster. For a typical EIT application a direct solver was significantly slower and not an alternative to iterative solvers with multigrid preconditioning. With this new solver we can compute the forward solutions and the Jacobian matrix of a typical EIT application with 30 electrodes on a 15 million element mesh in less than 15 minutes. This makes it a valuable tool for simulation studies and EIT applications with high precision requirements. It is freely available for download.},

These models quantify the impact of measurable and modifiable risk factors on the development of coronary heart disease and can be used to generate estimates of risk of coronary heart disease over a predetermined period, for example the next 10 years. We developed a system, which we call a points system, for making these complex statistical models useful to practitioners. The system is easy to use, it does not require a calculator or computer and it simplifies the estimation of risk based on complex statistical models. This system represents an effort to make available a tool for clinicians to aid in their decision-making process regarding treatment and to assist them in motivating patients toward healthy behaviours. The system is also readily available to patients who can easily estimate their own coronary heart disease risk and monitor this risk over time.},

abstract = {We examined whether trait disgust sensitivity predicts well-being in colostomy patients, and whether disgust predicts stigmatizing attitudes about colostomy in non-patients. 195 patients with a colostomy returned a mailed survey including measures of disgust sensitivity, life satisfaction, mood, and feelings of being stigmatized. We also conducted an internet-survey of a non-patient sample (n = 523). In the patient sample, we observed negative correlations between a bowel-specific measure of disgust sensitivity and life satisfaction (r = -.34, p {\textless} .01), and colostomy adjustment (r = -.42, p {\textless} .01), and a positive correlation with feeling stigmatized because of the colostomy (r = .54, p {\textless} .01). Correlations between a general trait disgust measure and these outcomes were more modest. A structural equation model indicated that colostomy patients who had high disgust sensitivity felt more stigmatized, and this was in turn strongly related to lower life satisfaction. Concordantly, in the non-patient sample we observed that disgust sensitivity was a significant, positive predictor of wanting less contact with colostomy patients (r = .22, p {\textless} .01). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Body composition was evaluated by bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and SM calculated by using Janssen's equation; therefore the sex-specific cut-off points of percentage skeletal muscle index were used. The whole population was divided in two age groups: A (18-40 years; n. 808; weight 115.4±23.5 kg; BMI 43.8±8.8 kg/m 2 ) and B (41-67 years; n. 438; weight 113.4±26.3 kg; BMI 44.8±9.9 kg/m 2 ). In all the sample there was 2.7{\%} moderate and 0.6{\%} severe sarcopenia; in group A, 1.9{\%} moderate and 0.6{\%} severe sarcopenia whilst in group B 4.3{\%} moderate and 0.7{\%} severe sarcopenia. The results of our study suggest that, based on a screening examination by BIA, moderate/severe sarcopenia can be detected in an unselected middle-aged obese population.

abstract = {Spatial interpolation methods have been applied to many disciplines. Many factors affect the performance of the methods, but there are no consistent findings about their effects. In this study, we use comparative studies in environmental sciences to assess the performance and to quantify the impacts of data properties on the performance. Two new measures are proposed to compare the performance of the methods applied to variables with different units/scales. A total of 53 comparative studies were assessed and the performance of 72 methods/sub-methods compared is analysed. The impacts of sample density, data variation and sampling design on the estimations of 32 methods are quantified using data derived from their application to 80 variables. Inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), and ordinary co-kriging (OCK) are the most frequently used methods. Data variation is a dominant impact factor and has significant effects on the performance of the methods. As the variation increases, the accuracy of all methods decreases and the magnitude of decrease is method dependent. Irregular-spaced sampling design might improve the accuracy of estimation. The effect of sampling density on the performance of the methods is found not to be significant. The implications of these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The purpose of this paper is to testify the feasibility of monitoring cerebral ischemia. By a newly developed high precision data acquisition system and specially configured imaging method, a series of imaging monitoring experiments were performed on 8 Chinese local rabbits, who have been induced with cortical ischemia by photochemical method. This method of induce ischemia was confirmed by histopathological examination. The imaging results show that impedance in target area increased rapidly 7-20 minutes after the beginning of the irradiation during ischemia induce process, and will still change rapidly during and after the induction of ischemia. Unexpected impedance fluctuations were also seen in 6 out of 8 animals during this process. Therefore, EIT monitoring technique proved to be a rapid and sensitive way to detect cerebral ischemia in very earlier stage.},

abstract = {Individuals with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) often have difficulties with complex auditory information processing. In a series of two Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies, we compared BOLD signal changes between Controls and individuals with CFS who had documented difficulties in complex auditory information processing (Study 1) and those who did not (Study 2) in response to performance on a simple auditory monitoring and a complex auditory information processing task (mPASAT). We hypothesized that under conditions of cognitive challenge: (1) individuals with CFS who have auditory information processing difficulties will utilize frontal and parietal brain regions to a greater extent than Controls and (2) these differences will be maintained even when objective difficulties in this domain are controlled for. Using blocked design fMRI paradigms in both studies, we first presented the auditory monitoring task followed by the mPASAT. Within and between regions of interest (ROI), group analyses were performed for both studies with statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Findings showed that individuals with CFS are able to process challenging auditory information as accurately as Controls but utilize more extensive regions of the network associated with the verbal WM system. Individuals with CFS appear to have to exert greater effort to process auditory information as effectively as demographically similar healthy adults. Our findings provide objective evidence for the subjective experience of cognitive difficulties in individuals with CFS. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Little is known about the relation of dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) to metabolic risk factors, particularly in non-Western populations. OBJECTIVE We examined the cross-sectional associations between dietary GI and GL and several metabolic risk factors in healthy Japanese women with traditional dietary habits. DESIGN The subjects were 1354 Japanese female farmers aged 20-78 y from 5 regions of Japan. Dietary GI and GL were assessed with a self-administered diet-history questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m). Fasting blood samples were collected for biochemical measurements. RESULTS The mean dietary GI was 67, and the mean dietary GL (/1000 kcal) was 88 (GI for glucose = 100). White rice (GI = 77) was the major contributor to dietary GI and GL (58.5{\%}). After adjustment for potential dietary and nondietary confounding factors, dietary GI was positively correlated with BMI (n = 1354; P for trend = 0.017), fasting triacylglycerol (n = 1349; P for trend = 0.001), fasting glucose (n = 764; P for trend = 0.022), and glycated hemoglobin (n = 845; P for trend = 0.038). Dietary GL was independently negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol (n = 1354; P for trend = 0.004) and positively correlated with fasting triacylglycerol (P for trend = 0.047) and fasting glucose (P for trend = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS Both dietary GI and GL are independently correlated with several metabolic risk factors in subjects whose dietary GI and GL were primarily determined on the basis of the GI of white rice.},

abstract = {The electrical impedance tomography (EIT) image reconstruction problem is ill posed and spatially variant. Because of the problem's ill-posed nature, small amounts of measurement noise can corrupt reconstructed images. The problem must be regularized to reduce image artifacts. In this paper, we focus on the spatially variant characteristics of the problem. Correcting errors due to spatial variance should improve reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we present methods to normalize the spatially variant image reconstruction problem by equalizing the point spread function (PSF). In order to equalize the PSF, we used the reconstruction blurring properties obtained from the sensitivity matrix. We compared three mathematical normalization schemes: pixel-wise scaling (PWS), weighted pseudo-inversion (WPI) and weighted minimum norm method (WMNM) to equalize images. The quantity index (QI), defined as the integral of pixel values of an EIT conductivity image, was considered in investigating spatial variance. The QI values along with reconstructed images are presented for cases of two-dimensional full array and hemiarray electrode topologies. We found that a spatially invariant QI could be obtained by applying normalization methods based on equalization of the PSF using conventional regularized reconstruction methods such as truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) and WMNM. We found that WMNM normalization applied to WMNM regularized reconstruction was the best of the methods tested overall, for both hemiarray and full array electrode topologies.},

abstract = {Drugs and food exert their reinforcing effects in part by increasing dopamine (DA) in limbic regions, which has generated interest in understanding how drug abuse/addiction relates to obesity. Here, we integrate findings from positron emission tomography imaging studies on DA's role in drug abuse/addiction and in obesity and propose a common model for these two conditions. Both in abuse/addiction and in obesity, there is an enhanced value of one type of reinforcer (drugs and food, respectively) at the expense of other reinforcers, which is a consequence of conditioned learning and resetting of reward thresholds secondary to repeated stimulation by drugs (abuse/addiction) and by large quantities of palatable food (obesity) in vulnerable individuals (i.e. genetic factors). In this model, during exposure to the reinforcer or to conditioned cues, the expected reward (processed by memory circuits) overactivates the reward and motivation circuits while inhibiting the cognitive control circuit, resulting in an inability to inhibit the drive to consume the drug or food despite attempts to do so. These neuronal circuits, which are modulated by DA, interact with one another so that disruption in one circuit can be buffered by another, which highlights the need of multiprong approaches in the treatment of addiction and obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutrients have been proposed to be related to metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aims of this study were to identify dietary patterns that correlated with several nutrients using reduced rank regression (RRR) and to examine the association between extracted dietary patterns and prevalence of MetS in a Japanese population. METHODS: The study population comprised 1,092 Japanese men and women (35-69 years old) who had participated in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study in Tokushima Prefecture. Dietary patterns were derived with RRR using 46 food items as predictors and six established nutrients (potassium, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, insoluble dietary fiber, and carotene) as response variables. Associations between extracted dietary patterns and MetS were then examined with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the six dietary patterns, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) explained the largest proportion (60.1{\%}) of variance in the six nutrients. Therefore, only DP1 was selected for further analysis. DP1 was characterized by high intake frequency of vegetables, fruits, fish and small fish, natto (fermented soybeans), and deep-fried tofu. After adjustment for potential confounders, significant inverse associations were found between DP1 score and MetS (odds ratio [OR] for each quartile: 1.00, 0.58, 0.60, 0.52; Ptrend = 0.02); DP1 and high blood pressure (Ptrend = 0.0002); and DP1 and high blood glucose (Ptrend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: A dietary pattern characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruits, fish and small fish, natto, and deep-fried tofu was associated with reduced prevalence of MetS in a Japanese population.},

abstract = {Oral malodor develops mostly from the metabolic activities of indigenous bacterial populations within the oral cavity, but whether healthy or oral malodor-related patterns of the global bacterial composition exist remains unclear. In this study, the bacterial compositions in the saliva of 240 subjects complaining of oral malodor were divided into groups based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles using hierarchical cluster analysis, and the patterns of the microbial community composition of those exhibiting higher and lower malodor were explored. Four types of bacterial community compositions were detected (clusters I, II, III, and IV). Two parameters for measuring oral malodor intensity (the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air and the organoleptic score) were noticeably lower in cluster I than in the other clusters. Using multivariate analysis, the differences in the levels of oral malodor were significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors such as total bacterial count, mean periodontal pocket depth, and tongue coating score (P {\textless} 0.001). Among the four clusters with different proportions of indigenous members, the T-RFLP profiles of cluster I were implicated as the bacterial populations with higher proportions of Streptococcus, Granulicatella, Rothia, and Treponema species than those of the other clusters. These results clearly correlate the global composition of indigenous bacterial populations with the severity of oral malodor.},

abstract = {Cross-sectional imaging of an electrical conductivity distribution inside the human body has been an active research goal in impedance imaging. By injecting current into an electrically conducting object through surface electrodes, we induce current density and voltage distributions. Based on the fact that these are determined by the conductivity distribution as well as the geometry of the object and the adopted electrode configuration, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) reconstructs cross-sectional conductivity images using measured current-voltage data on the surface. Unfortunately, there exist inherent technical difficulties in EIT. First, the relationship between the boundary current-voltage data and the internal conductivity distribution bears a nonlinearity and low sensitivity, and hence the inverse problem of recovering the conductivity distribution is ill posed. Second, it is difficult to obtain accurate information on the boundary geometry and electrode positions in practice, and the inverse problem is sensitive to these modeling errors as well as measurement artifacts and noise. These result in EIT images with a poor spatial resolution. In order to produce high-resolution conductivity images, magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) has been lately developed. Noting that injection current produces a magnetic as well as electric field inside the imaging object, we can measure the induced internal magnetic flux density data using an MRI scanner. Utilization of the internal magnetic flux density is the key idea of MREIT to overcome the technical difficulties in EIT. Following original ideas on MREIT in early 1990s, there has been a rapid progress in its theory, algorithm and experimental techniques. The technique has now advanced to the stage of human experiments. Though it is still a few steps away from routine clinical use, its potential is high as a new impedance imaging modality providing conductivity images with a spatial resolution of a few millimeters or less. This paper reviews MREIT from the basics to the most recent research outcomes. Focusing on measurement techniques and experimental methods rather than mathematical issues, we summarize what has been done and what needs to be done. Suggestions for future research directions, possible applications in biomedicine, biology, chemistry and material science are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the association between adherence to the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top and total and cause specific mortality. DESIGN Large scale population based prospective cohort study in Japan with follow-up for a median of 15 years. SETTING 11 public health centre areas across Japan. PARTICIPANTS 36,624 men and 42,970 women aged 45-75 who had no history of cancer, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, or chronic liver disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deaths and causes of death identified with the residential registry and death certificates. RESULTS Higher scores on the food guide (better adherence) were associated with lower total mortality; the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence interval) of total mortality for the lowest through highest scores were 1.00, 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97), 0.88 (0.83 to 0.93), and 0.85 (0.79 to 0.91) (P{\textless}0.001 for trend) and the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio associated with a 10 point increase in food guide scores was 0.93 (0.91 to 0.95; P{\textless}0.001 for trend). This score was inversely associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio associated with a 10 point increase 0.93, 0.89 to 0.98; P=0.005 for trend) and particularly from cerebrovascular disease (0.89, 0.82 to 0.95; P=0.002 for trend). There was some evidence, though not significant, of an inverse association for cancer mortality (0.96, 0.93 to 1.00; P=0.053 for trend). CONCLUSION Closer adherence to Japanese dietary guidelines was associated with a lower risk of total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease, particularly from cerebrovascular disease, in Japanese adults.},

This method was validated in a collaborative trial organized by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). Following further work on bound 2,3-epoxy-1-propanol (glycidol) as a possible precursor for 3-MCPD-Esters, the German Standard method was modified in 2009 to determine ester-bound 3-chloro-1,2-propandiol and 2,3-epoxy-1-propanol. The modified DGF standard method, together with a similar method, developed by SGS Hamburg (Kuhlmann method), was validated in an international collaborative study. The results of this collaborative study are reported for vegetable fats and oils, using gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection and two different deuterated internal standards. Altogether, 17 laboratories from 5 countries (D - E - F - HU - USA) expressed interest in participation. The test was carried out according to ISO 5725:1994 - Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results and the Guidelines for Collaborative Study Procedures To Validate Characteristics of a Method of Analysis (AOCS 2002). The results are reported.Practical applicationFor the quantitative determination of 3-MCPD- and glycidyl-esters in refined fats and oils standardised methods are not yet available. Two similar methods for the quantification of the sum of ester-bound 3-MCPD and Glycidol and for ester-bound 3-MCPD alone were tested in an international collaborative trial.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the adequacy and inadequacy of dietary patterns in pregnant women for which information is absolutely lacking. DESIGN Diet was assessed by a validated, self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ). Dietary patterns were extracted from the intake of thirty-three food groups (g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), which were summarized from 147 foods assessed with the DHQ, by cluster analysis. Nutritional inadequacy for selected twenty nutrients in each dietary pattern was examined using the reference values given in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for Japanese as the temporal gold standard. SETTING Japan. SUBJECTS Nine hundred and ninety-seven pregnant Japanese women aged 18-43 years. RESULTS The three dietary patterns identified were labelled as 'meat and eggs' (n 423), 'wheat products' (n 371) and 'rice, fish and vegetables' (n 203). The 'rice, fish and vegetables' pattern characterized by high intake of rice, vegetables, potatoes, pulses, fruits, seaweed, fish and miso soup showed significantly the lowest prevalence of inadequate intake for fifteen nutrients and significantly the highest prevalence of inadequate sodium intake. In contrast, the 'wheat products' pattern characterized by high intake of bread, noodles, confectioneries and soft drinks showed the highest prevalence of inadequate intake for fourteen nutrients. The median number of nutrients not meeting the DRI as a marker of overall nutritional inadequacy was eight in the 'rice, fish and vegetables' pattern. It was significantly lower at ten in the 'meat and eggs' and eleven in the 'wheat products' patterns (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS In pregnant Japanese women, the dietary pattern high in rice, fish, vegetables, fruit and some others showed a better profile of nutritional adequacy except for sodium.},

abstract = {Bio-electric impedance signatures arise primarily from differences in cellular morphologies within an organ and can be used to differentiate benign and malignant pathologies, specifically in the breast. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging modality that determines the impedance distribution within tissue and has been used in prior work to map the electrical properties of breast at signal frequencies ranging from a few kHz to 1 MHz. It has been suggested that by extending the frequency range, additional information of clinical significance may be obtained. We have, therefore, developed a new EIT system for breast imaging which covers the frequency range from 10 kHz to 10 MHz. The instrument developed here is a distributed processor tomograph with 64 channels, capable of generating and measuring voltages and currents. Electrical benchmarking has shown the system to have a SNR greater than 94 dB up to 2 MHz, 90 dB up to 7 MHz, and 65 dB at 10 MHz. In addition, the system measures impedances to an accuracy of 99.7 {\%} and has channel-to-channel variations of less than 0.05 {\%}. Phantom imaging has demonstrated the ability to image across the entire frequency range in both single- and multiplane configurations. Further, 96 women have participated safely in breast exams with the system and the associated conductivity spectra obtained from 3-D image reconstructions range from 0.0237 S/m at 10 kHz to 0.2174 S/m at 10 MHz. These findings are consistent with impedance values reported in the literature.},

The results will be applied to the future repricing of drugs and medical devices. On the basis of a request from the Central Social Insurance Medical Council (Chuikyo), our research team drafted the official methodological guideline for trial implementation. Here, we report the process of developing and the contents of the official guideline for cost-effectiveness evaluation. Methods The guideline reflects discussions at the Chuikyo subcommittee (e.g., the role of quality-adjusted life-year) and incorporates our academic perspective. Team members generated research questions for each section of the guideline and discussions on these questions were carried out. A draft guideline was prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), and then to the subcommittee. The draft guideline was revised on the basis of the discussions at the subcommitte, if appropriate. Results Although the “public health care payer's perspective” is standard in this guideline, other perspectives can be applied as necessary depending on the objective of analysis. On the basis of the discussions at the subcommittee, quality-adjusted life-year will be used as the basic outcome. A discount rate of 2{\%} per annum for costs and outcomes is recommended. The final guideline was officially approved by the Chuikyo general assembly in February 2016. Conclusions This is the first officially approved guideline for the economic evaluation of drugs and medical devices in Japan. The guideline is expected to improve the quality and comparability of submitted cost-effectiveness data for decision making.},

abstract = {Studies of the effect of exercise programs on bone mass appear inconsistent. Our objective was to systematically review and meta-analyze randomized trials of the effect of exercise on bone mass in pre- and postmenopausal women. A computerized MEDLINE search was conducted for the years 1966-1997. Thirty-five randomized trials were identified. Meta-analytic methods were used to statistically pool results of studies of the effect of impact (e.g., aerobics) and non-impact (e.g., weight training) exercise on the lumbar spine and femoral neck. The most studied bone site was the lumbar spine in postmenopausal women (15 studies), where both impact [1.6{\%} bone loss prevented, 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI): 1.0{\%}-2.2{\%}] and non-impact (1.0{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 0.4{\%}-1.6{\%}) exercise programs had a positive effect. Results for the lumbar spine in premenopausal women (eight studies) were similar: 1.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.6{\%}-2.4{\%}) less bone loss (or net gain) after impact exercise and 1.2{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.7{\%}-1.7{\%}) after non-impact exercise. Impact exercise programs appeared to have a positive effect at the femoral neck in postmenopausal women (five studies), 1.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.4{\%}-1.6{\%}) bone loss prevented, and possibly in premenopausal women, 0.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: -0.2{\%}-2.0{\%}) bone loss prevented. There were too few trials to draw conclusions from meta-analyses of the effect of non-impact exercise on the neck of femur. This systematic review of randomized trials shows that both impact and non-impact exercise have a positive effect at the lumbar spine in pre- and postmenopausal women. Impact exercise probably has a positive effect at the femoral neck. More studies are required to determine the optimal intensity and type of exercise.},

METHODS The causal relationship of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with the risk of glucose deterioration and glycemic traits was compared using two different genetic instruments based on 30 BMI loci and 6 WHR loci with Mendelian randomization (MR) in three prospective cohorts (n = 6,476). RESULTS Each 1-SD genetically instrumented higher WHR was associated with a 65.7{\%} higher risk of glucose deterioration (95{\%} CI = 1.069-2.569, P = 0.024), whereas no significant association of BMI with glucose deterioration was observed. Furthermore, a causal relationship was found only between BMI and homeostatic model assessment $\beta$-cell function (HOMA-B) ($\beta$ = 0.143, P = 0.001), and there was a nominal association with Stumvoll second-phase insulin secretion traits ($\beta$ = 0.074, P = 0.022). The significance level did not persist in sensitivity analyses, except in the causal estimate of WHR on the Gutt index in MR-Egger ($\beta$ = -0.379, P = 0.022) and the causal estimate of BMI on homeostatic model assessment $\beta$-cell function in weighted median MR ($\beta$ = 0.128, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS The data from this study support the potential causal relationship between abdominal obesity and hyperglycemia, which may be driven by aggravated insulin resistance, in contrast with the potential causal relationship between overall obesity and insulin secretion.},

abstract = {Food craving (defined as an intense desire to eat a specific food) is of interest because it is extremely common and because it influences obesity or nutritional status. It has also been suggested that food craving may be the evolutionary source for cravings of all kinds including cravings for drugs and alcohol. Yet, little is known about the functional neuroanatomy of food craving. We report here the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to explicitly examine food craving. A two-part technique was used to produce the food cravings. Threshold was reduced through a diet manipulation (monotonous diet) and cravings were triggered during blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI sessions by having subjects imagine the sensory properties of favorite foods (a cue-induction technique). Subjects were also asked to imagine the monotonous diet (which they did not crave). Diet condition had an activating effect on both behavioral (reports of craving) and fMRI measures. Craving-related changes in fMRI signal were identified in the hippocampus, insula, and caudate, three areas reported to be involved in drug craving. Thus, this work supports the common substrate hypothesis for food and drug cravings. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Obesity is considered a protective factor for osteoporosis improving bone mass and maintaining higher levels of estrogen during menopause. OBJECTIVE To determine the association of obesity with bone mineral density (BMD), and its relationship with sex hormone levels. DESIGN A case-control study in Caucasian obese and non obese postmenopausal women. SUBJECTS 113 obese and 50 non-obese postmenopausal women. MEASUREMENTS BMD (dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry) at cervical femur. Ward's triangle, proximal radius and lumbar spine. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, total estrogen, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHA-S) and testosterone. RESULTS Mean BMD at femoral sites were significantly higher in obese women (femoral neck: 0.849 +/- 0.124 g/cm2 vs 0.753 +/- 0.095 g/cm2, P {\textless} 0.001; Ward's triangle: 0.634 +/- 0.134 g/cm2 vs. 0.553 +/- 0.100 g/cm2, P {\textless} 0.001). Mean BMD at lumbar spine was 0.906 +/- 0.138 g/cm2 in obese women and 0.849 +/- 0.137 g/cm2 in non obese, P {\textless} 0.017. A decreased risk of osteopenia in femoral neck (Age adjusted OR = 0.36, 95{\%}CI 0.17-0.75) and in lumbar spine (Age adjusted OR = 0.43, 95{\%}CI 0.20-0.91) in obese women was observed. Although total estrogen were similar in both groups, in obese women, SHBG was lower (68.6 +/- 26.84 nmol/l vs. 85.1 +/- 31.18 nmol/l, P {\textless} 0.001), and postglucose load insulin levels were higher, than in non obese (77.2 +/- 50.4 Ul/ml vs. 49.4 +/- 24.1 Ul/ml, P {\textless} 0.0005). CONCLUSION The findings confirm a higher BMD in obese women and suggest that obesity exerts protection due to a decreased SHBG thus increasing free sex steroids. Besides, hyperinsulinemia may produce a decline in the production of IGFBG-1, leading to an increase of IGF-1, that may stimulate the proliferation of osteoblasts.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Caffeine acutely increases blood pressure, but the association between habitual consumption of caffeinated beverages and incident hypertension is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between caffeine intake and incident hypertension in women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study conducted in the Nurses' Health Studies (NHSs) I and II of 155,594 US women free from physician-diagnosed hypertension followed up over 12 years (1990-1991 to 2002-2003 questionnaires). Caffeine intake and possible confounders were ascertained from regularly administered questionnaires. We also tested the associations with types of caffeinated beverages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident physician-diagnosed hypertension. RESULTS: During follow-up, 19,541 incident cases of physician-diagnosed hypertension were reported in NHS I and 13,536 in NHS II. In both cohorts, no linear association between caffeine consumption and risk of incident hypertension was observed after multivariate adjustment (NHS I, P for trend = .29; NHS II, P for trend = .53). Using categorical analysis, an inverse U-shaped association between caffeine consumption and incident hypertension was found. Compared with participants in the lowest quintile of caffeine consumption, those in the third quintile had a 13{\%} and 12{\%} increased risk of hypertension, respectively (95{\%} confidence interval in NHS I, 8{\%}-18{\%}; in NHS II, 6{\%}-18{\%}). When studying individual classes of caffeinated beverages, habitual coffee consumption was not associated with increased risk of hypertension. By contrast, consumption of cola beverages was associated with an increased risk of hypertension, independent of whether it was sugared or diet cola (P for trend {\textless}.001). CONCLUSION: No linear association between caffeine consumption and incident hypertension was found. Even though habitual coffee consumption was not associated with an increased risk of hypertension, consumption of sugared or diet cola was associated with it. Further research to elucidate the role of cola beverages in hypertension is warranted.},

We measured plasma adiponectin levels and genotyped +45T {\textgreater} G (rs2241766) and +276 G {\textgreater} T (rs1501299) in the ADIPOQ gene among 417 incident diabetes cases and 1197 control subjects matched by age, sex, and area. Results After potential confounding factor adjustment, the multivariable-adjusted diabetes odds ratios (ORs) were 0.59 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.51–0.68) and 0.68 (95{\%} CI: 0.60–0.78) per 1 standard deviation increment in the log-transformed levels of total- and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin levels, respectively. However, the ADIPOQ variants were not significantly associated with plasma adiponectin levels (for total adiponectin, +45 P = 0.15 and +276 P = 0.08) and diabetes risk (+45 P = 0.70 and +276 P = 0.72) under the additive genetic model.

This pilot study was conducted to quantitatively assess liver fibrosis using ultrasound. Methods: Fibrosis extraction ratios (FER) (fiber volume/total volume) of ultrasound and histological images of 8 autopsy specimens were compared. We also compared FER of ultrasound images from clinical patients (n=79) with histological fibrosis stages. Results: In the autopsy study, FER correlation coefficient between histological images and ultrasound images was 0.992. Regarding clinical patients, there was sufficient evidence to indicate differences in the distributions of FER for each fibrosis stage (Kruskal-Wallis test P{\textless}0.0001). With FER cut-off to distinguish ≥F2 from F0 and F1 defined as mean plus standard deviation of F0 and F1, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio were 62, 75, 78, 57{\%}, and 2.47, respectively. Regarding HCV cohort (n=44), they were 55, 87, 89, 50{\%}, and 4.14, respectively.

This was single dose ingestion study, in a double blind cross over manner and postprandial lipid concentrations were compared between diacylglycerol oil (DAG) and triacylglycerol oil (TAG) ingestion. The subjects were 18 male volunteers and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R) was used to classify them into insulin sensitive (IS, n = 10, HOMA-R {\textless} 2.0) and insulin resistant (IR, n = 8, HOMA-R ≥ 2.0) groups. Fasting serum triglycerides (TG) and remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) correlated with HOMA-R and were significantly higher in the IR as compared to the IS group. Postprandial increments of TG and RLP-C after DAG ingestion were significantly lower as compared to those after TAG ingestion. In a case of TAG ingestion, their increments positively correlated with HOMA-R and were significantly higher in the IR as compared with the IS group. In contrast, their increments remained constant after DAG ingestion in both groups. In the IR group, the postprandial lipidemia were reduced after DAG ingestion to about half of those after TAG ingestion. In conclusion, DAG reduced postprandial lipidemia especially in subjects with insulin resistance and may be beneficial in preventing atherosclerosis and related diseases. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Objectives Despite the verification of measles elimination, Japan experienced multiple generations of measles transmission following importation events in 2016. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the transmission dynamics of measles in Japan, 2016, estimating the transmission potential in the partially vaccinated population. Methods All diagnosed measles cases were notified to the government, and the present study analyzed two pieces of datasets independently, i.e., the transmission tree of the largest outbreak in Osaka (n = 49) and the final size distribution of all importation events (n = 23 events). Branching process model was employed to estimate the effective reproduction number Rv, and the analysis of transmission tree in Osaka enabled us to account for the timing of introducing contact tracing and case isolation. Results Employing a negative binomial distribution for the offspring distribution, the model with time-dependent decline in Rvdue to interventions appeared to best fit to the transmission tree data with Rvof 9.20 (95{\%} CI (confidence interval): 2.08, 150.68) and the dispersion parameter 0.32 (95{\%} CI: 0.07, 1.17) before interventions were introduced. The relative transmissibility in the presence of interventions from week 34 was estimated at 0.005. Analyzing the final size distribution, models for subcritical and supercritical processes fitted equally well to the observed data, and the estimated reproduction number from both models did not exclude the possibility that Rv{\textgreater} 1. Conclusions Our results likely reflect the highly contagious nature of measles, indicating that Japan is at risk of observing multiple generations of measles transmission given imported cases. Considering that importation events may continue in the future, supplementary vaccination of adults needs to be considered.},

abstract = {Structured illumination technique enhances the lateral resolution by projecting non-uniform intensity patterns on a sample. In a typical implementation, three lateral phase shifts (0, 2$\pi$/3, 4$\pi$/3) are needed for each orientation of the sinusoidal pattern, and 3 different orientations are needed to double the bandwidth isotopically in the Fourier domain. To this end, 9 incoherent images are needed in the acquisition process. In this paper, we discuss an imaging strategy for the structured illumination technique and demonstrate the use of a modified incoherent Fourier ptychographic procedure for reducing the number of acquisitions. In the first implementation, we used complementary sinusoidal patterns for sample illumination. We show that, the number of lateral phase shifts can be reduced from 3 to 2 for each orientation of the sinusoidal pattern and the total number of image acquisitions can be reduced to 6 with 3 orientations. In the second implementation, we further reduce the number of image acquisitions to 4. We also show that, the resolution-doubled image can be recovered even with unknown phases of the sinusoidal patterns. We validate the proposed imaging procedure with non-fluorescence samples. The reported approach may shorten the acquisition time of super-resolution imaging and reduce phototoxicity of biological samples.},

A nonlinear normalization model which is called exponential model for electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) with external electrodes under gap permittivity conditions has been developed. The exponential model normalization is proposed based on the inherently nonlinear relationship characteristic between the mixture permittivity and the measured capacitance due to the gap permittivity of inner wall. The parameters of exponential equation are derived by using an exponential fitting curve based on the simulation and a scaling function is added to adjust the experiment system condition. The exponential model normalization was applied to two dimensional low and high contrast dielectric distribution phantoms by using simulation and experimental studies. The proposed normalization model has been compared with other normalization models i.e. Parallel, Series, Maxwell and B{\"{o}}ttcher models. Based on the comparison of image reconstruction results, the exponential model is reliable to predict the nonlinear normalization of measured capacitance in term of low and high contrast dielectric distribution.},

abstract = {Nutritional state (e.g. fasted vs. fed) and different food stimuli (e.g. high-calorie vs. low-calorie, or appetizing vs. bland foods) are both recognized to change activity in brain reward systems. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we have studied the interaction between nutritional state and different food stimuli on brain food reward systems. We examined how blood oxygen level-dependent activity within a priori regions of interest varied while viewing pictures of high-calorie and low-calorie foods. Pictures of non-food household objects were included as control stimuli. During scanning, subjects rated the appeal of each picture. Twenty non-obese healthy adults [body mass index 22.1 +/- 0.5 kg/m(2) (mean +/- SEM), age range 19-35 years, 10 male] were scanned on two separate mornings between 11:00 and 12:00 h, once after eating a filling breakfast ('fed': 1.6 +/- 0.1 h since breakfast), and once after an overnight fast but skipping breakfast ('fasted': 15.9 +/- 0.3 h since supper) in a randomized cross-over design. Fasting selectively increased activation to pictures of high-calorie over low-calorie foods in the ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior insula, and medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Furthermore, fasting enhanced the subjective appeal of high-calorie more than low-calorie foods, and the change in appeal bias towards high-calorie foods was positively correlated with medial and lateral OFC activation. These results demonstrate an interaction between homeostatic and hedonic aspects of feeding behaviour, with fasting biasing brain reward systems towards high-calorie foods.},

abstract = {Synthetic astaxanthin (S-AX) was tested against natural astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis microalgae (N-AX) for antioxidant activity. In vitro studies conducted at Creighton University and Brunswick Laboratories showed N-AX to be over 50 times stronger than S-AX in singlet oxygen quenching and approximately 20 times stronger in free radical elimination. N-AX has been widely used over the last 15 years as a human nutraceutical supplement after extensive safety data and several health benefits were established. S-AX, which is synthesised from petrochemicals, has been used as a feed ingredient, primarily to pigment the flesh of salmonids. S-AX has never been demonstrated to be safe for use as a human nutraceutical supple- ment and has not been tested for health benefits in humans. Due to safety concerns with the use of synthetic forms of other carotenoids such as can- thaxanthin and beta-carotene in humans, the au- thors recommend against the use of S-AX as a hu- man nutraceutical supplement until extensive, long-term safety parameters have been established and human clinical trials have been conducted showing potential health benefits. Additionally, differences in various other properties between S- AX and N-AX such as stereochemistry, esterification and the presence of supporting naturally occurring carotenoids in N-AX are discussed, all of which elicit further questions as to the safety and potential health benefits of S-AX. Ultimately, should S-AX prove safe for direct human consumption, dosage levels roughly 20–30 times greater than N-AX should be used as a result of the extreme difference in antioxidant activity between the two forms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Few data are available about the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions for preventing influenza virus transmission. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether hand hygiene and use of facemasks prevents household transmission of influenza. DESIGN Cluster randomized, controlled trial. Randomization was computer generated; allocation was concealed from treating physicians and clinics and implemented by study nurses at the time of the initial household visit. Participants and personnel administering the interventions were not blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00425893) SETTING Households in Hong Kong. PATIENTS 407 people presenting to outpatient clinics with influenza-like illness who were positive for influenza A or B virus by rapid testing (index patients) and 794 household members (contacts) in 259 households. INTERVENTION Lifestyle education (control) (134 households), hand hygiene (136 households), or surgical facemasks plus hand hygiene (137 households) for all household members. MEASUREMENTS Influenza virus infection in contacts, as confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or diagnosed clinically after 7 days. RESULTS Sixty (8{\%}) contacts in the 259 households had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection in the 7 days after intervention. Hand hygiene with or without facemasks seemed to reduce influenza transmission, but the differences compared with the control group were not significant. In 154 households in which interventions were implemented within 36 hours of symptom onset in the index patient, transmission of RT-PCR-confirmed infection seemed reduced, an effect attributable to fewer infections among participants using facemasks plus hand hygiene (adjusted odds ratio, 0.33 [95{\%} CI, 0.13 to 0.87]). Adherence to interventions varied. LIMITATION The delay from index patient symptom onset to intervention and variable adherence may have mitigated intervention effectiveness. CONCLUSION Hand hygiene and facemasks seemed to prevent household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 hours of index patient symptom onset. These findings suggest that nonpharmaceutical interventions are important for mitigation of pandemic and interpandemic influenza. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Washing the hands using cleansers with antiseptic materials is the most popular method for hand hygiene and helps maintain health by preventing food poisoning and bacterial infections. However, repeated hand washing tends to induce eczema of the hand, such as dryness, cracking and erythema. Moreover, eczema on the hand leads to increased levels of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) on the skin surface in contrast to expectations. Thus, mild hand cleansers which induce less eczema even with repeated washings are desired. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a hand cleanser formulated with alkyl ether sulfate (AES), alkyl ether carboxylic acid (AEC) and alkyl glucoside (AG) that contains isopropyl methylphenol (IPMP) on skin symptoms and S. aureus levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eczema of the hand and the presence of S. aureus on the skin surface were analyzed prior to and following 4 weeks of usage of the hand cleanser. A soap-based hand cleanser with IPMP was used as a reference cleanser. Eczema and cutaneous conditions were evaluated by visual grading, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum moisture-retention ability (MRA) and skin surface pH.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The repeated use of the soap-based hand cleanser significantly worsened the hand dryness, scaling and cracks on the tips of the fingers and significantly increased the TEWL and decreased the MRA. In contrast, usage of the test cleanser only induced a significant increase in skin dryness but did not induce skin scaling or cracking, and did not increase TEWL or decrease the MRA. Corresponding to these changes in skin symptoms, the presence of S. aureus increased following use of the reference cleanser but not the test cleanser. There was no significant difference in skin surface pH between the two cleansers. Moreover the increase in S. aureus was significantly correlated to the worsening of skin dryness and scaling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that not only antimicrobial activity but also the mildness, which minimizes cutaneous effects, are important for hand cleansers to prevent the growth of S. aureus. The cleanser formulated with AES, AEC and AG containing IPMP is mild and is effective to promote hand hygiene. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Morbidity and mortality associated with increased white fat accumulation in visceral fat depots have focused attention on the pathways regulating the development of this tissue during embryogenesis, in adulthood, and while under the influence of obesogenic diets. Adipocytes undergo clonal expansion, differentiation (adipogenesis) and maturation through a complex network of transcriptional factors, most of which are expressed at similar levels in visceral and subcutaneous fat. Rigorous research attempts to unfold the pathways regulating expression and activity of adipogenic transcription factors that act in a fat-depot-specific manner. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) is the master regulator of adipogenesis, and is expressed at higher levels in subcutaneous than in visceral depots. PPAR$\gamma$ expression in adipogenesis is mediated by CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and several transcription factors acting in conjunction with C/EBPs, although alternative pathways through zinc-finger protein-423 (ZFP423) transcription factor are sufficient to induce PPAR$\gamma$ expression and adipogenesis. Vitamin A and its metabolites, retinaldehyde and retinoic acid, are transcriptionally-active molecules. Retinoic acid is generated from retinaldehyde in adipose tissue by the aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 family of enzymes (Aldh1). In this review, we discuss the role of Aldh1 enzymes in the generation of retinoic acid during adipogenesis, in the regulation of the transcriptional network of PPAR$\gamma$ in a fat-depot-specific manner, and the important contribution of this autocrine pathway in the development of visceral obesity.

abstract = {There are many definitions of functional foods, although with a common element of providing some functional advantage to consumers, and they are almost universally associated with food innovation. In Australia, the National Centre of Excellence in Functional Foods (NCEFF) was established with five-year federal innovation funding to help build capability in functional food research and development. This review sets the context for the NCEFF science program, by first outlining global concepts of functional foods and the nature of the scientific enterprise associated with it. The review provides a working definition of functional foods, describes the types of research reported in Medline in the last year and compares this with the NCEFF program of research. The ‘working space' for functional foods was found to relate to the nutritional and food sciences, regulatory conditions, consumer/market and health concerns and industry opportunity. The term is appearing increasingly in Medline, mostly under review articles, but also with respect to in vitro and animal model studies, human clinical trials and consumer research. The spectrum of research undertaken in the NCEFF science program was consistent with this pattern. The review found that Australian researchers and practitioners have the capacity to deliver on major fronts in the functional foods domain and to be part of the challenges for food and nutrition research that have been exposed through the functional food phenomenon.

This study was designed to compare the effects of a web-based program alone or together with measurement and self-awareness of accumulated visceral fat in Japanese workers. A new noninvasive device to measure visceral fat accumulation was introduced, and efficacy on weight-loss and improvement of healthy behaviors were examined. This study was conducted according to Helsinki declaration and approved by the ethical committee of Japan Hospital Organization, National Kyoto Hospital. Two-hundred and sixteen overweight and obese males with BMI of more than 23 participated from 8 healthcare offices of 3 Japanese private companies. Subjects were randomly allocated into control group, Web-based weight-loss program (Web), or Web + Visceral fat measurement group (Web + VFA). Eighty-one percent of participants completed the study. Reductions of body weight, waist circumference, and BMI were the largest in Web + VFA group, and the differences between groups were significant by ANOVA. Improvements of healthy behaviors were the largest in Web + VFA group, and the differences of healthy eating improvement scores between Web + VFA and control groups were significant. Our findings suggest that measurement and awareness of visceral fat are effective in weight reduction in overweight and obese males in the workplace.},

abstract = {The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test is the most commonly used nonparametric method to compare two treatments when the underlying distribution of the outcome variable is not normally distributed. In the presence of stratum effects, the van Elteren (vE) test, a stratified WMW test, can be used to adjust for the stratum effect. We provide guidance on how to choose between the two tests in the design phase of clinical trials and in the analysis of clinical data. We show by simulations that both tests preserve the type I error rate regardless of the presence of the stratum effects. Therefore, the test with greater power is preferred. In comparing powers, we found that the WMW test is better when the stratum effects are small, whereas the vE test is better when the stratum effects are large. Finally, when the stratum effects are moderate, the decision depends on the shape of the distribution and the ratio of the number of strata and the number of subjects. In this case, results presented in this article or from similar simulations may be used to determine which test is better.},

abstract = {An anatomical parcellation of the spatially normalized single-subject high-resolution T1 volume provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (D. L. Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science.},

abstract = {Live vaccination against polio has effectively prevented outbreaks in most developed countries for more than 40 years, and there remain only a few countries where outbreaks of poliomyelitis by the wild strain still threaten the community. It is expected that worldwide eradication will be eventually achieved through careful surveillance and a well-managed immunization program. The present paper argues, however, that based on a simple stochastic model the risk of outbreak by a vaccine-derived strain after the cessation of vaccination is quite high, even if many years have passed since the last confirmed case. As vaccinated hosts are natural reservoirs for virulent poliovirus, the source of the risk is the vaccination itself, employed to prevent the outbreaks. The crisis after stopping vaccination will emerge when the following two conditions are met: the susceptible host density exceeds the threshold for epidemics and the vaccinated host density remains large enough to ensure the occurrence of virulent mutants in the population. Our estimates for transmission, recovery, and mutation rates, show that the probability of an outbreak of vaccine-derived virulent viruses easily exceeds 90{\%}. Moreover, if a small fraction of hosts have a longer infectious period, as observed in individuals with innate immunodeficiency, the risk of an outbreak rises significantly. Under such conditions, successful global eradication of polio is restricted to a certain range of parameters even if inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is extensively used after the termination of live vaccination.},

abstract = {The long-term ingestion of tea catechins has been reported to reduce body fat. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the long-term ingestion of tea catechins on postprandial energy expenditure and dietary fat oxidation. Twelve healthy men aged 27– 48 years participated in the study. The subjects con- sumed 350 ml of a test beverage/day that contained either a high dose of catechin (592.9 mg) or a low dose of catechin (77.7 mg) for a period of 12 weeks. Respi- ratory analyses were conducted before and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks during the test period, in which oxygen con- sumption and the excretion of 13 CO2 over 8 hr after a single ingestion of a test meal con- taining 13 C labeled triglyceride. The excretion of 13 were monitored CO2 in the high dose catechin group (the HC group) was significantly increased at 4 and 12 weeks of the test period compared to that for the low dose catechin group (the LC group) (p {\textless} 0.05), and this elevation persisted at 8.9{\%} at week 0 to 12.9{\%} at week 12. Di- etary induced thermogenesis (DIT), defined as an in- creased energy expenditure from the fasting baseline for 8 hr after the single ingestion of a test meal, was significantly higher in the HC group at 8 and 12 weeks compared to that in the LC group (p {\textless} 0.05) with el- evation to 90.3 kcal at week 12 from 51.4 kcal at week 0. In conclusion, enhanced dietary fat oxidation and an increased DIT may play an important role in the mechanism of the anti-obesity effect of tea cat- echins.},

Seven different triptans will soon be clinically available, making evidence-based selection guidelines necessary. Triptan trials have similar designs, facilitating meta-analysis; this will provide a foundation for using triptans in clinical practice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: We asked pharmaceutical companies and the principal investigators of company-independent trials for raw patient data of all double-blind, randomised, controlled, clinical trials of oral triptans in migraine. We calculated summary estimates across studies for important efficacy and tolerability parameters, and separately summarised direct comparator trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 53 clinical trials (12 unpublished) involving 24089 patients, met the criteria for inclusion. Mean results for 100 mg sumatriptan were 59{\%} (95{\%} CI 57-60) for 2 h headache response (improvement from moderate or severe to mild or no pain); 29{\%} (27-30) for 2 h pain free (improvement to no pain); 20{\%} (18-21) for sustained pain free (pain free by 2 h and no headache recurrence or use of rescue medication 2-24 h post dose); and 67{\%} (63-70) for consistency (response in at least two of three treated attacks); placebo-subtracted proportions for patients with at least one adverse event (AE) were 13{\%} (8-18), for at least one central nervous system AE 6{\%} (3-9), and for at least one chest AE 1.9{\%} (1.0-2.7). Compared with these data, 10 mg rizatriptan showed better efficacy and consistency, and similar tolerability; 80 mg eletriptan showed better efficacy, similar consistency, but lower tolerability; 12.5 mg almotriptan showed similar efficacy at 2 h but better other results; 2.5 mg naratriptan and 20 mg eletriptan showed lower efficacy and (the first two) better tolerability; 2.5 mg and 5 mg zolmitriptan, 40 mg eletriptan, and 5 mg rizatriptan showed very similar results. The results of the 22 trials that directly compared triptans show the same overall pattern. We received no data on frovatriptan, but publicly available data suggest lower efficacy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: At marketed doses, all oral triptans were effective and well tolerated. 10 mg rizatriptan, 80 mg eletriptan, and 12.5 mg almotriptan provide the highest likelihood of consistent success.},

abstract = {Hyaluronan (HA) plays an important role in the development and maintenance of tissues, and its degradation is implicated in many pathologic conditions. We recently reported that HA-binding protein involved in HA depolymerization (CEMIP; alias HYBID/KIAA1199) is a key molecule in HA depolymerization, but its developmental and pathologic functions remain elusive. We generated Hybid-deficient mice using the Cre/locus of crossover in P1 (loxP) system and analyzed their phenotypes. Hybid-deficient mice were viable and fertile, but their adult long bones were shorter than those of wild-type animals. Hybid-deficient mice showed lengthening of hypertrophic zone in the growth plate until 4 weeks after birth. There were fewer capillaries and osteoclasts at the chondroosseous junction in the Hybid-deficient mice compared with the wild-type mice. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Hybid was expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes at the chondroosseous junction. Cultured primary chondrocytes expressed higher levels of Hybid than did osteoblasts or osteoclasts, and the Hybid expression in the chondrocytes was up-regulated after maturation to hypertrophic chondrocytes. High–molecular-weight HA was accumulated in the lengthened hypertrophic zone in Hybid-deficient mice. In addition, high–molecular-weight HA significantly reduced cell growth and tube formation in vascular endothelial growth factor–stimulated or –nonstimulated endothelial cells. HA metabolism by HYBID is involved in endochondral ossification during postnatal development by modulation of angiogenesis and osteoclast recruitment at the chondroosseous junction.},

We calculated the changes in metabolic risk factors in relation to changes in certain anthropometric indices in a large-scale study of Japanese men.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects were 1,106 men participating in the Hitachi Health Study who received a computed tomography examination in both 2004 and 2007. VFA, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and waist circumference were measured using the computed tomography. We examined how longitudinal changes in each anthropometric index over a 3-year period influenced the value of each metabolic risk factor.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Changes ($\Delta$) over a 3-year period in body weight, SFA, and waist circumference strongly correlated, while the changes in body weight and VFA were weakly correlated. Changes in the VFA were associated with changes in metabolic risk factors, especially changes in triglyceride and HDL; we found these changes to be independent of the body weight and waist circumference.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Change in body weight is not a precise surrogate marker of VFA, and repeated VFA measurements over time are useful. Adopting a lifestyle that does not increase the VFA is important in preventing metabolic syndrome.},

Methods and resultsWe investigated whether rice bran and triterpene alcohol and sterol preparation (TASP) lowered hyperglycemia in mice and humans. Brown rice and white rice supplemented with TASP lowered the postprandial hyperglycemia in humans. TASP and its components (cycloartenol {\{}[{\}}CA], 24-methylene cycloartanol, -sitosterol, and campesterol) decreased postprandial hyperglycemia in C57BL/6J mice. Glucose transport into everted rat intestinal sacs and human HuTu80 cells transfected with sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1) was significantly reduced by the addition of CA. Intracellular localization analysis suggested that SGLT1 translocation to the apical plasma membrane was inhibited when the cells were treated with CA. ConclusionsWe demonstrated for the first time that TASP from rice bran lowered postprandial hyperglycemia in mice and humans. The smaller increase in blood glucose following TASP consumption may be due to the CA-induced decrease in glucose absorption from the intestine, which may be related to decreased membrane translocation of SGLT1.},

abstract = {The prevalence of obesity is increasing globally, and obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We investigated the effects of coffee polyphenols (CPP), which are abundant in coffee and consumed worldwide, on diet-induced body fat accumulation. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet, a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet supplemented with 0.5 to 1.0{\%} CPP for 2-15 wk. Supplementation with CPP significantly reduced body weight gain, abdominal and liver fat accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissues. Energy expenditure evaluated by indirect calorimetry was significantly increased in CPP-fed mice. The mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 and -2, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 in the liver were significantly lower in CPP-fed mice than in high-fat control mice. Similarly, CPP suppressed the expression of these molecules in Hepa 1-6 cells, concomitant with an increase in microRNA-122. Structure-activity relationship studies of nine quinic acid derivatives isolated from CPP in Hepa 1-6 cells suggested that mono- or di-caffeoyl quinic acids (CQA) are active substances in the beneficial effects of CPP. Furthermore, CPP and 5-CQA decreased the nuclear active form of SREBP-1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, and cellular malonyl-CoA levels. These findings indicate that CPP enhances energy metabolism and reduces lipogenesis by downregulating SREBP-1c and related molecules, which leads to the suppression of body fat accumulation.},

It has recently gained special interest because of its applicability for monitoring ventilation and pulmonary perfusion. Its bedside and continuous implementation, and the fact that it is a non-ionizing and non-invasive technique, makes it an extremely attractive measurement tool. Likewise, given its ability to assess the regional characteristics of lung structure, it could be considered an ideal monitoring tool in the heterogeneous lung with acute lung injury. This review explains the physical concept of bioimpedance and its clinical application, and summarizes the scientific evidence published to date with regard to the implementation of electrical impedance tomography as a method for monitoring ventilation and perfusion, mainly in the patient with acute lung injury, and other possible applications of the technique in the critically ill patient. The review also summarizes the limitations of the technique and its potential areas of future development.},

abstract = {In rodents, brown adipose tissue (BAT) regulates cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis (CIT; DIT). Whether BAT recruitment is reversible and how it impacts on energy metabolism have not been investigated in humans. We examined the effects of temperature acclimation on BAT, energy balance, and substrate metabolism in a prospective crossover study of 4-month duration, consisting of four consecutive blocks of 1-month overnight temperature acclimation (24 °C [month 1] → 19 °C [month 2] → 24 °C [month 3] → 27 °C [month 4]) of five healthy men in a temperature-controlled research facility. Sequential monthly acclimation modulated BAT reversibly, boosting and suppressing its abundance and activity in mild cold and warm conditions (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively, independent of seasonal fluctuations (P {\textless} 0.01). BAT acclimation did not alter CIT but was accompanied by DIT (P {\textless} 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity enhancement (P {\textless} 0.05), evident only after cold acclimation. Circulating and adipose tissue, but not skeletal muscle, expression levels of leptin and adiponectin displayed reciprocal changes concordant with cold-acclimated insulin sensitization. These results suggest regulatory links between BAT thermal plasticity and glucose metabolism in humans, opening avenues to harnessing BAT for metabolic benefits.},

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that utilizes genetic variants that are robustly associated with such modifiable exposures to generate more reliable evidence regarding which interventions should produce health benefits. The approach is being widely applied, and various ways to strengthen inference given the known potential limitations of MR are now available. Developments of MR, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, network MR, two-step MR, factorial MR and multiphenotype MR, are outlined in this review. The integration of genetic information into population-based epidemiological studies presents translational opportunities, which capitalize on the investment in genomic discovery research.},

abstract = {There is profound global interest in the Japanese diet as a possible partial explanation for the Japanese people's favorable health status and longevity. The diet differs substantially from that found in western countries and is often deemed a good guide for people who design healthy diets around the world. Japan had a marked westernization of diets between 1960 and 1975, characterized by an increase in average fat intake from 20 to 55 g per person daily. During this time, age-standardized mortality rates from stroke and stomach cancer—the two main chronic diseases in Japan at the time—started to decrease. Japan, like many other countries, has had a striking increase in the number of people suspected to have diabetes since the mid to late 1990s. But this increase comes at a time when energy intake has steadily decreased from 1970 until the latest year for which data are available, 2009. The survey has historically been household-based, but this method has been changed to a combination of weighing foods within households and approximating the proportion of foods shared by family members. As a consequence, the survey has been of very limited use in building evidence in the discipline of nutrition and health. As long as the survey continues to be done and reported in the current manner, it will not fulfil its potential as a valuable resource for health. This would be a serious loss for Japan and, as a consequence, the world too. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is not yet resolved how lifestyle factors and intermediate phenotypes interrelate with metabolic pathways. We aimed to investigate the associations between diet, physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and obesity with serum metabolite networks in a population-based study. METHODS: The present study included 2380 participants of a randomly drawn subcohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam. Targeted metabolomics was used to measure 127 serum metabolites. Additional data were available including anthropometric measurements, dietary assessment including intake of whole-grain bread, coffee and cake and cookies by food frequency questionnaire, and objectively measured physical activity energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory fitness in a subsample of 100 participants. In a data-driven approach, Gaussian graphical modeling was used to draw metabolite networks and depict relevant associations between exposures and serum metabolites. In addition, the relationship of different exposure metabolite networks was estimated. RESULTS: In the serum metabolite network, the different metabolite classes could be separated. There was a big group of phospholipids and acylcarnitines, a group of amino acids and C6-sugar. Amino acids were particularly positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. C6-sugar and acylcarnitines were positively associated with obesity and inversely with intake of whole-grain bread. Phospholipids showed opposite associations with obesity and coffee intake. Metabolite networks of coffee intake and obesity were strongly inversely correlated (body mass index (BMI): r = -0.57 and waist circumference: r = -0.59). A strong positive correlation was observed between metabolite networks of BMI and waist circumference (r = 0.99), as well as the metabolite networks of cake and cookie intake with cardiorespiratory fitness and intake of whole-grain bread (r = 0.52 and r = 0.50; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle factors and phenotypes seem to interrelate in various metabolic pathways. A possible protective effect of coffee could be mediated via counterbalance of pathways of obesity involving hepatic phospholipids. Experimental studies should validate the biological mechanisms.},

abstract = {Adiponectin, an adipose-derived hormone, exhibits various biological functions, such as increasing insulin sensitivity, protecting hypertension, and suppression of atherosclerosis, liver fibrosis, and tumor growth. Here, we report the role of adiponectin on bone metabolism. C57BL/6J mice were treated with adenovirus expressing lacZ or adiponectin, and their bones were analyzed by three-dimensional microcomputed tomography. Adiponectin-adenovirus treatment increased trabecular bone mass, accompanied by decreased number of osteoclasts and levels of plasma NTx, a bone-resorption marker. In vitro studies showed that adiponectin inhibited M-CSF- and RANKL-induced differentiation of mouse bone marrow macrophages and human CD14-positive mononuclear cells into osteoclasts and also suppressed the bone-resorption activity of osteoclasts. Furthermore, adiponectin enhanced mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization activity of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Our results indicate that adiponectin exerts an activity to increase bone mass by suppressing osteoclastogenesis and by activating osteoblastogenesis, suggesting that adiponectin manipulation could be therapeutically beneficial for patients with osteopenia. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The relationship between coffee consumption and serum cholesterol was examined in the comparison group of a case-control study of myocardial infarction involving 642 patients from various Italian regions who were hospitalized for diseases having no relationship to cardiovascular disease risk factors. Overall mean total cholesterol was 198.9 mg/dl. Mean cholesterol values (in mg/dl) standardized for age, sex, and smoking habits were 204.0 for nonconsumers of coffee, 194.8 for drinkers of one cup per day, 196.5 for two, 202.9 for three, 205.9 for four, and 206.5 for five or more cups per day. Thus, serum cholesterol levels were higher in non-coffee drinkers than in moderate drinkers; among coffee drinkers, however, there was a direct, although moderate, relationship between the amount of coffee consumed and the total cholesterol levels. A similar though less consistent pattern was also evident across separate strata of sex, age, and smoking habits, and the association was appreciably greater among younger subjects (below age 50). Although mean cholesterol levels in this Italian dataset were lower than those in other populations from northern Europe and the United States, the relative difference between moderate and heavy drinkers was proportionally similar to that reported in other studies. These results are of special interest since most Italian coffee (i.e., mocha or espresso) is unfiltered.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity has increased at an alarming rate in recent years and is now a worldwide health problem. We investigated the effects of long-term feeding with tea catechins, which are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds widely consumed in Asian countries, on the development of obesity in C57BL/6J mice. DESIGN: We measured body weight, adipose tissue mass and liver fat content in mice fed diets containing either low-fat (5{\%} triglyceride (TG)), high-fat (30{\%} TG), or high-fat supplemented with 0.1-0.5{\%} (w/w) tea catechins for 11 months. The beta-oxidation activities and related mRNA levels were measured after 1 month of feeding. RESULTS: Supplementation with tea catechins resulted in a significant reduction of high-fat diet-induced body weight gain, visceral and liver fat accumulation, and the development of hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia. Feeding with tea catechins for 1 month significantly increased acyl-CoA oxidase and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase mRNA expression as well as beta-oxidation activity in the liver. CONCLUSION: The stimulation of hepatic lipid metabolism might be a factor responsible for the anti-obesity effects of tea catechins. The present results suggest that long-term consumption of tea catechins is beneficial for the suppression of diet-induced obesity, and it may reduce the risk of associated diseases including diabetes and coronary heart disease.},

abstract = {A novel magnetocardiographic inverse method for reconstructing the action potential amplitude (APA) and the activation time (AT) on the ventricular myocardium is proposed. This method is based on the propagated excitation model, in which the excitation is propagated through the ventricle with nonuniform height of action potential. Assumption of stepwise waveform on the transmembrane potential was introduced in the model. Spatial gradient of transmembrane potential, which is defined by APA and AT distributed in the ventricular wall, is used for the computation of a current source distribution. Based on this source model, the distributions of APA and AT are inversely reconstructed from the QRS interval of magnetocardiogram (MCG) utilizing a maximum a posteriori approach. The proposed reconstruction method was tested through computer simulations. Stability of the methods with respect to measurement noise was demonstrated. When reference APA was provided as a uniform distribution, root-mean-square errors of estimated APA were below 10 mV for MCG signal-to-noise ratios greater than, or equal to, 20 dB. Low-amplitude regions located at several sites in reference APA distributions were correctly reproduced in reconstructed APA distributions. The goal of our study is to develop a method for detecting myocardial ischemia through the depression of reconstructed APA distributions.},

abstract = {Originally, leptin was described as a product of adipocytes that acts on the hypothalamus to regulate appetite. However, subsequently, it has been shown that leptin receptors are distributed widely and that leptin has diverse functions, including promotion of hemopoietic and osteoblastic differentiation. It has been recognized for some time that both serum leptin and bone mass are correlated positively to body fat mass and, recently, we have shown a direct positive relationship between serum leptin and bone mass in nonobese women. We now report that leptin inhibits osteoclast generation in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and murine spleen cells incubated on bone in the presence of human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hM-CSF) and human soluble receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (sRANKL). The half-maximal concentration inhibitory of leptin was approximately 20 nM in the presence of sRANKL at 40 ng/ml but decreased to approximately 2 nM when sRANKL was used at 5 ng/ml. The majority of the inhibitory effect occurred in the first week of the 3-week cultures. Inhibition did not occur when the PBMC cultures were washed vigorously to remove nonadherent cells or when purified CD14+ monocytes were used to generate osteoclasts, indicating an indirect or permissive effect via CD14- PBMC. Leptin increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in PBMC but not in CD14+ cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effect may be mediated by the RANKL/RANK/OPG system. Leptin may act locally to increase bone mass and may contribute to linkage of bone formation and resorption.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Adiponectin is a key mediator of the metabolic syndrome that is caused by visceral fat accumulation. Adiponectin and its receptors are known to be expressed in osteoblasts, but their actions with regard to bone metabolism are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of adiponectin on the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. RESULTS Adiponectin receptor type 1 (AdipoR1) mRNA was detected in the cells by RT-PCR. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) was phosphorylated by both adiponectin and a pharmacological AMP kinase activator, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR), in the cells. AdipoR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection potently knocked down the receptor mRNA, and the effect of this knockdown persisted for as long as 10 days after the transfection. The transfected cells showed decreased expressions of type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA, as determined by real-time PCR, and reduced ALP activity and mineralization, as determined by von Kossa and Alizarin red stainings. In contrast, AMP kinase activation by AICAR (0.01-0.5 mM) in wild-type MC3T3-E1 cells augmented their proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. BrdU assay showed that the addition of adiponectin (0.01-1.0 mug/ml) also promoted their proliferation. Osterix, but not Runx-2, appeared to be involved in these processes because AdipoR1 siRNA transfection and AICAR treatments suppressed and enhanced osterix mRNA expression, respectively. CONCLUSION Taken together, this study suggests that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts via the AdipoR1 and AMP kinase signaling pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions.},

The girls' eating when exposed to palatable foods in the absence of hunger was measured after they consumed a standard lunch and indicated that they were no longer hungry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Eating in the absence of hunger showed moderate stability across the 2-y period for most of the girls. The girls who ate large amounts of snack foods in the absence of hunger at 5 and 7 y of age were 4.6 times as likely to be overweight at both ages. Parents' reports of restricting their daughter's access to foods at age 5 y predicted girls' eating in the absence of hunger at age 7 y, even when the girls' weight status and eating in the absence of hunger at age 5 y were controlled for.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that young girls' eating in the absence of hunger may represent a stable phenotypic behavior of young overweight girls. In addition, these findings are consistent with previous work indicating that parents' restrictive feeding practices may contribute to this behavior.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated an important physiologic link between bone and fat. Bone and fat cells arise from the same mesenchymal precursor cell within bone marrow, capable of differentiation into adipocytes or osteoblasts. Increased BMI appears to protect against osteoporosis. However, recent studies have suggested detrimental effects of visceral fat on bone health. Increased visceral fat may also be associated with decreased growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels which are important for maintenance of bone homeostasis. The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between vertebral bone marrow fat and trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), abdominal fat depots, GH and IGF-1 in premenopausal women with obesity. We studied 47 premenopausal women of various BMI (range: 18-41 kg/m², mean 30 ± 7 kg/m²) who underwent vertebral bone marrow fat measurement with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), body composition, and trabecular BMD measurement with computed tomography (CT), and GH and IGF-1 levels. Women with high visceral fat had higher bone marrow fat than women with low visceral fat. There was a positive correlation between bone marrow fat and visceral fat, independent of BMD. There was an inverse association between vertebral bone marrow fat and trabecular BMD. Vertebral bone marrow fat was also inversely associated with IGF-1, independent of visceral fat. Our study showed that vertebral bone marrow fat is positively associated with visceral fat and inversely associated with IGF-1 and BMD. This suggests that the detrimental effect of visceral fat on bone health may be mediated in part by IGF-1 as an important regulator of the fat and bone lineage.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging modality that estimates the electrical properties at the interior of an object from measurements made on its surface. Typically, currents are injected into the object through electrodes placed on its surface, and the resulting electrode voltages are measured. An appropriate set of current patterns, with each pattern specifying the value of the current for each electrode, is applied to the object, and a reconstruction algorithm uses knowledge of the applied current patterns and the measured electrode voltages to solve the inverse problem, computing the electrical conductivity and permittivity distributions in the object. This article focuses on the type of EIT called adaptive current tomography (ACT) in which currents are applied simultaneously to all the electrodes. A number of current patterns are applied, where each pattern defines the current for each electrode, and the subsequent electrode voltages are measured to generate the data required for image reconstruction. A ring of electrodes may be placed in a single plane around the object, to define a two-dimensional problem, or in several layers of such rings, to define a three-dimensional problem. The reconstruction problem is described and two algorithms are discussed, a one-step, two-dimensional (2-D) Newton-Raphson algorithm and a one-step, full three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructor. Results from experimental data are presented which illustrate the performance of the algorithms},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE A meta-analysis showed an inverse association of a prudent/healthy dietary pattern with all-cause mortality and no association of a western/unhealthy dietary pattern. However, the association of distinctive dietary patterns of Japanese population with mortality remains unclear. We prospectively investigated the association between dietary patterns and all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality among Japanese adults. METHODS Participants were 36,737 men and 44,983 women aged 45-74 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (1995-1998) and who had no history of serious disease. Dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis of the consumption of 134 food and beverage items ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios of death from the second survey to December 2012 were estimated using cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS A prudent dietary pattern, which was characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruit, soy products, potatoes, seaweed, mushrooms, and fish, was significantly associated with decreased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality for the highest versus lowest quartile of the prudent dietary pattern score were 0.82 (0.77 to 0.86) and 0.72 (0.64 to 0.79), respectively (P for trend {\textless}0.001 in both). A Westernized dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of meat, processed meat, bread, and dairy products, was also inversely associated with risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality. A traditional Japanese dietary pattern was not associated with these risks. CONCLUSIONS The prudent and Westernized dietary patterns were associated with a decreased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in Japanese adults.},

DESIGN The relations between sc and visceral adiposity and the cross-sectional dimensions and polar and principal moments of the femur in 100 healthy women ages 15 to 25 years were obtained using computed tomography. RESULTS Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that, after adjusting for leg length and thigh musculature, both sc and visceral fat had strong and independent associations with femoral cross-sectional area, cortical bone area, principal moment maximum, principal moment minimum, and polar moment (all P values {\textless} 0.03). However, whereas sc fat had a positive predictive value with all femoral bone phenotypes, a similar but negative effect was observed between visceral fat and these measures (all P values {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS We found that visceral and sc fat have opposite effects on the appendicular skeleton; whereas sc fat is beneficial to bone structure and strength, visceral fat serves as an unique pathogenic fat depot.},

abstract = {Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PNLE) affects limbic portions of the brain associated with recognition of social signals of emotions. Yet it is not known whether this perceptual ability is impaired in individuals with PNLE. We therefore conducted a single case study to explore possible impairments in recognising facially, vocally and bodily expressed emotions, using standardised emotion recognition tests. Facial expression recognition was tested with two forced-choice emotion-labelling tasks using static faces with either prototypical or morphed blends of basic emotions. Recognition of vocally and bodily expressed emotions was also tested with forced-choice labelling tasks, one based on prosodic cues, the other on whole-body movement cues. We found a deficit in fear and disgust recognition from both face and voice, while recognition of bodily expressed emotions was unaffected. These findings are consistent with data from previous studies demonstrating critical roles for certain brain regions - particularly the amygdala and insular cortex - in processing facially and vocally displayed basic emotions, and furthermore, suggest that recognition of bodily expressed emotions may not depend on neural structures involved in facial and vocal emotion recognition. Impaired facial and vocal emotion recognition may form a further neuropsychological marker of limbic encephalitis, in addition to the already well-described mnestic deficits. ?? 2009 Elsevier Srl.},

abstract = {Childhood diet is important for brain development. Furthermore, the quality of breakfast is thought to affect the cognitive functioning of well-nourished children. To analyze the relationship among breakfast staple type, gray matter volume, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in 290 healthy children, we used magnetic resonance images and applied voxel-based morphometry. We divided subjects into rice, bread, and both groups according to their breakfast staple. We showed that the rice group had a significantly larger gray matter ratio (gray matter volume percentage divided by intracranial volume) and significantly larger regional gray matter volumes of several regions, including the left superior temporal gyrus. The bread group had significantly larger regional gray and white matter volumes of several regions, including the right frontoparietal region. The perceptual organization index (POI; IQ subcomponent) of the rice group was significantly higher than that of the bread group. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, intracranial volume, socioeconomic status, average weekly frequency of having breakfast, and number of side dishes eaten for breakfast. Although several factors may have affected the results, one possible mechanism underlying the difference between the bread and the rice groups may be the difference in the glycemic index (GI) of these two substances; foods with a low GI are associated with less blood-glucose fluctuation than are those with a high GI. Our study suggests that breakfast staple type affects brain gray and white matter volumes and cognitive function in healthy children; therefore, a diet of optimal nutrition is important for brain maturation during childhood and adolescence.},

Subjects were 221 adult men with a mean (+/-SD) age and body mass index of 52.1 +/- 8.7 yr and 23.6 +/- 2.8 kg/m2. Serum leptin, carboxyterminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (PICP; a marker of bone formation), and cross-linked carboxyterminal teleopeptide of type 1 collagen (a marker of bone resorption) were measured by RIA. BMD was assessed by single photon absorptiometry, and total fat mass was determined by bioimpedance analysis. BMD was inversely associated with serum leptin concentrations and total fat mass after adjustment for body weight. PICP, but not cross-linked carboxyterminal teleopeptide of type 1 collagen, was inversely correlated with serum leptin. These results may suggest that an increase in serum leptin reduces bone formation and decreases BMD in adult men. Leptin may be a regulator of BMD in humans.},

abstract = {Electromyography computed tomography (EMG-CT) method is proposed for visualizing the individual muscle activities in the human forearm. An EMG conduction model was formulated for reverse-estimation of muscle activities using EMG signals obtained with multi surface electrodes. The optimization process was calculated using sequential quadratic programming by comparing the estimated EMG values from the model with the measured values. The individual muscle activities in the deep region were estimated and used to produce an EMG tomographic image. For validation of the method, isometric contractions of finger muscles were examined for three subjects, applying a flexion load (4.9, 7.4 and 9.8 N) to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger. EMG signals in the forearm were recorded during the tasks using multiple surface electrodes, which were bound around the subject's forearm. The EMG-CT method illustrates the distribution of muscle activities within the forearm. The change in amplitude and area of activated muscles can be observed. The normalized muscle activities of all three subjects appear to increase monotonically with increases in the load. Kinesiologically, this method was able to estimate individual muscle activation values and could provide a novel tool for studying hand function and development of an examination for evaluating rehabilitation.},

When the cholestyramine treatment group was analyzed separately, a 19{\%} reduction in CHD risk was also associated with each decrement of 8{\%} in TOTAL-C or 11{\%} in LDL-C levels (P less than .001). Moreover, CHD incidence in men sustaining a fall of 25{\%} in TOTAL-C or 35{\%} in LDL-C levels, typical responses to the prescribed dosage (24 g/day) of cholestyramine resin, was half that of men who remained at pretreatment levels. Adherence to medication was associated with reduced incidence of CHD only when accompanied by falls in TOTAL-C and LDL-C levels. Small increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, which accompanied cholestyramine treatment, independently accounted for a 2{\%} reduction in CHD risk. Thus, the reduction of CHD incidence in the cholestyramine group seems to have been mediated chiefly by reduction of TOTAL-C and LDL-C levels.},

abstract = {Estrogen is known to have a direct effect on bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts. The cellular and molecular effects of estrogen on osteoblasts and osteoblasts-like cells have been extensively studied. However, the effect of estrogen on the mechanical property of osteoblasts has not been studied yet. It is important since mechanical property of the mechanosensory osteoblasts could be pivotal to its functionality in bone remodeling. This is the first study aimed to assess the direct effect of estradiol on the apparent elastic modulus (E*) and corresponding cytoskeletal changes of human fetal osteoblasts (hFOB 1.19). The cells were cultured in either medium alone or medium supplemented with $\beta$-estradiol and then subjected to Atomic Force Microscopy indentation (AFM) to determine E*. The underlying changes in cytoskeleton were studied by staining the cells with TRITC-Phalloidin. Following estradiol treatment, the cells were also tested for proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization. With estradiol treatment, E* of osteoblasts significantly decreased by 43-46{\%}. The confocal images showed that the changes in f-actin network observed in estradiol treated cells can give rise to the changes in the stiffness of the cells. Estradiol also increases the inherent alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. Estradiol induced stiffness changes of osteoblasts were not associated with changes in the synthesized mineralized matrix of the cells. Thus, a decrease in osteoblast stiffness with estrogen treatment was demonstrated in this study, with positive links to cytoskeletal changes. The estradiol associated changes in osteoblast mechanical properties could bear implications for bone remodeling and its mechanical integrity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Similarly, the dielectric properties, namely the relative dielectric constant, relative dielectric loss factor and dielectric dissipa- tion factor were 688, 10.8 X 103, and 15.7, respectively. The electrical properties were found to be highly dependent on the frequency and the moisture content of bone. The bone was also found to be highly aniso- tropic in its electrical behavior, the impedance being lowest in the axial direction. It is shown that the differential method provides an accurate means of measuring the electrical properties of bone, avoiding stray ca- pacitance errors. I.},

abstract = {Sarcopenia, a newly recognized geriatric syndrome, is characterized by age-related decline of skeletal muscle plus low muscle strength and/or physical performance. Previous studies have confirmed the association of sarcopenia and adverse health outcomes, such as falls, disability, hospital admission, long term care placement, poorer quality of life, and mortality, which denotes the importance of sarcopenia in the health care for older people. Despite the clinical significance of sarcopenia, the operational definition of sarcopenia and standardized intervention programs are still lacking. It is generally agreed by the different working groups for sarcopenia in the world that sarcopenia should be defined through a combined approach of muscle mass and muscle quality, however, selecting appropriate diagnostic cutoff values for all the measurements in Asian populations is challenging. Asia is a rapidly aging region with a huge population, so the impact of sarcopenia to this region is estimated to be huge as well. Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) aimed to promote sarcopenia research in Asia, and we collected the best available evidences of sarcopenia researches from Asian countries to establish the consensus for sarcopenia diagnosis. AWGS has agreed with the previous reports that sarcopenia should be described as low muscle mass plus low muscle strength and/or low physical performance, and we also recommend outcome indicators for further researches, as well as the conditions that sarcopenia should be assessed. In addition to sarcopenia screening for community-dwelling older people, AWGS recommends sarcopenia assessment in certain clinical conditions and healthcare settings to facilitate implementing sarcopenia in clinical practice. Moreover, we also recommend cutoff values for muscle mass measurements (7.0 kg/m2for men and 5.4 kg/m2for women by using dual X-ray absorptiometry, and 7.0 kg/m2for men and 5.7 kg/m2for women by using bioimpedance analysis), handgrip strength ({\textless}26 kg for men and {\textless}18 kg for women), and usual gait speed ({\textless}0.8 m/s). However, a number of challenges remained to be solved in the future. Asia is made up of a great number of ethnicities. The majority of currently available studies have been published from eastern Asia, therefore, more studies of sarcopenia in south, southeastern, and western Asia should be promoted. On the other hand, most Asian studies have been conducted in a cross-sectional design and few longitudinal studies have not necessarily collected the commonly used outcome indicators as other reports from Western countries. Nevertheless, the AWGS consensus report is believed to promote more Asian sarcopenia research, and most important of all, to focus on sarcopenia intervention studies and the implementation of sarcopenia in clinical practice to improve health care outcomes of older people in the communities and the healthcare settings in Asia. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Medical Directors Association, Inc.},

It has the potential to become a portable non-invasive medical imaging technique. Until now, implementations have neglected anisotropy even though human tissues such as bone, muscle and brain white matter are markedly anisotropic. We present a numerical solution using the finite-element method that has been modified for modelling anisotropic conductive media. It was validated in an anisotropic domain against an analytical solution in an isotropic medium after the isotropic domain was diffeomorphically transformed into an anisotropic one. Convergence of the finite element to the analytical solution was verified by showing that the finite-element error norm decreased linearly related to the finite-element size, as the mesh density increased, for the simplified case of Laplace's equation in a cubic domain with a Dirichlet boundary condition.},

abstract = {Aims Review controlled clinical trials of isoflavones and amino acid preparation effects on hot flashes and at least one other symptom including mood, sleep, pain, and cognitive function that women report during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause. Methods An experienced reference librarian searched PubMed/Medline, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, AMED, and Alt-Health Watch for English-language randomized controlled trials between 2004 and July 2011. Seventeen trials of isoflavones and amino acid effects on hot flashes and one additional symptom were identified. Results In five trials of soy isoflavone preparations, two (6 g soy germ extract and 25 g soy protein in soy nuts) significantly decreased hot flashes, but no other symptoms. In the seven trials of other isoflavones, six significantly reduced hot flashes; in addition, red clover (80 mg) significantly reduced mood symptoms; Rexflavone (350 mg) for women with Kupperman Index {\textgreater} 20 significantly reduced sleep symptoms; two trials had significant reductions for pain: isoflavone powder (90 mg) and red clover (80 mg). The only trial in this systematic review that significantly reduced cognitive symptoms was red clover (80 mg). In one trial, red clover isoflavone (80 mg/day) significantly relieved hot flashes, mood, pain, and cognitive symptoms. Amino acids yielded no significant results. Equol supplements of 30 mg/day for non-Equol producing women significantly reduced mood symptoms in one trial. The magnolia bark extract combination significantly reduced hot flashes, mood, and sleep symptoms. Conclusions Isoflavone trials yielded significant reductions on hot flashes and co-occurring symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopause, but studies require replication with larger sample sizes and attention to measurement of outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {A central problem in natural science is identifying general laws of cause and effect. Medical science is devoted to revealing causal relationships in humans. The framework for causal inference applied in epidemiology can contribute substantially to clearly specifying and testing causal hypotheses in many other areas of biomedical research. In this article, we review the importance of defining explicit research hypotheses to make valid causal inferences in medical studies. In the counterfactual model, a causal effect is defined as the contrast between an observed outcome and an outcome that would have been observed in a situation that did not actually happen. The fundamental problem of causal inference should be clear; individual causal effects are not directly observable, and we need to find general causal relationships, using population data. Under an "ideal" randomized trial, the assumption of exchangeability between the exposed and the unexposed groups is met; consequently, population-level causal effects can be estimated. In observational studies, however, there is a greater risk that the assumption of conditional exchangeability may be violated. In summary, in this article, we highlight the following points: (1) individual causal effects cannot be inferred because counterfactual outcomes cannot, by definition, be observed; (2) the distinction between concepts of association and concepts of causation and the basis for the definition of confounding; (3) the importance of elaborating specific research hypotheses in order to evaluate the assumption of conditional exchangeability between the exposed and unexposed groups; (4) the advantages of defining research hypotheses at the population level, including specification of a hypothetical intervention, consistent with the counterfactual model. In addition, we show how understanding the counterfactual model can lay the foundation for correct interpretation of epidemiologic evidence.},

Biodiesel from microalgae seems to be the only renewable biofuel that has the potential to completely displace petroleum-derived transport fuels without adversely affecting supply of food and other crop products. Most productive oil crops, such as oil palm, do not come close to microalgae in being able to sustainably provide the necessary amounts of biodiesel.

Our data sources included a MEDLINE search of the literature published before December 1997, bibliography review, and expert consultation. We selected controlled trials in which coffee consumption was the only difference between the intervention and control groups, mean blood pressure change was reported for each group or period, and treatment lasted for {\textgreater}24 hours. Of 36 studies initially identified, 11 (522 participants) met these inclusion criteria. Information on sample size, study design, participant characteristics (gender, race, age, baseline blood pressure, and antihypertensive medications), and treatment results were abstracted by 3 reviewers using a standardized protocol. Treatment effect of coffee consumption on blood pressure was estimated with the use of a random-effects model. In the 11 trials, median duration was 56 days (range, 14 to 79 days), and median dose of coffee was 5 cups/d. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by 2.4 (range, 1.0 to 3.7) mm Hg and 1.2 (range, 0.4 to 2.1) mm Hg, respectively, with coffee treatment compared with control. Multiple linear regression analysis identified an independent, positive relationship between cups of coffee consumed and subsequent change in systolic blood pressure, independent of age of study participants and study design characteristics. The effect of coffee drinking on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was greater in trials with younger participants. Our findings provide support for a relationship between coffee consumption and higher blood pressure. Trials of coffee cessation of longer duration and in persons with hypertension should be performed.},

abstract = {While there have been significant advances in capturing data from the entities across complex real-world systems, their associations and relationships are largely unknown. Associations between the entities may reveal interesting system-level properties that may not be apparent otherwise. Often these associations are hypothesized by superimposing knowledge across distinct reductionist representations of these entities obtained from disparate sources. Such representations, while useful, may provide only an incomplete picture of the associations. This can be attributed to their dependence on prior knowledge and failure of the principle of superposition in general. Such representations may also be unhelpful in discovering novel undocumented associations. A more rigorous approach would be to identify associations from data measured simultaneously across the entities of interest from a given system. These data sets or digital signatures are quantized in time and amplitude and in turn may (dynamic) or may not (static) contain explicit temporal information. Symmetric measures such as correlation have been helpful in modeling direct associations as undirected graphs. However, it is well appreciated that the association between a given pair of entities may be indirect and often mediated through others. Symmetric measures are also immune to the direction of association by their very definition. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks have especially proven to be useful in this regard. The vertices (nodes) represent the entities of interest, the arcs (edges) represent their associations, and the entire Bayesian network represents the joint probability distribution between the entities of interest. Bayesian networks networks. It introduces the reader to structure and parameter learning from multiple independent realizations of data sets without explicit temporal information. Such data sets are quite common and represent a snapshot of the process. The impact of discretization on the network inference with application to molecular expression data is also discussed. The lack of temporal information implicitly excludes the presence of feedback or cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graphical representation of the associations between the entities. These limitations are overcome by learning networks from data sets with explicit temporal signatures. In Chap. 3, we discuss the usefulness of dynamic Bayesian networks for learning the network structure in the presence of explicit temporal information such as multivariate time series. Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks are discussed. In Chap. 4, static and dynamic Bayesian network inference methods are discussed. Some of the network learning algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are computationally intensive limiting their usefulness across large and high-dimensional data sets. Parallelization options for some of the algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are discussed in Chap. 5 to overcome some of these limitations.},

One hundred and twenty obese Japanese women (age, 58.8 ± 9.4 years; body mass index, 32.2 ± 4.9 kg/m2) were enrolled. Angiotensinogen genotypes were determined with a fluorescent allele-specific DNA primer assay system. Subjects were divided into M/M, M/T, and T/T groups. Control subjects comprised 146 healthy age-matched women. Clinical characteristics and the effects of diet and exercise therapy for 6 months were compared among the 3 genotypes. The genotype frequencies of AGT M235T polymorphism were in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equation (obese: M/M, 6.7{\%}; M/T, 27.5{\%}; T/T, 65.8{\%}; control: M/M, 6.8{\%}; M/T, 21.2{\%}; T/T, 71.9{\%}). The frequency of the T allele did not differ between obese and control subjects (0.80 vs 0.83). As the number of obese women with M/M genotype was only 8, comparisons of the characteristics and outcomes of weight reduction therapy were performed only between subjects with M/T genotype and T/T genotype. In the T/T group, {\%} body fat and waist circumference at baseline were significantly greater than in the M/T group (36.3{\%} ± 4.8{\%} vs 33.8{\%} ± 4.7{\%}, P = .0105; 107.9 ± 10.9 vs 102.6 ± 7.9 cm, P = .0428, respectively). Before the weight reduction therapy, significantly higher insulin and higher homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R) were demonstrated in the T/T group than in the M/T group (9.1 ± 5.5 $\mu$U/mL vs 5.9 ± 4.4 $\mu$U/mL, P = .0056; 2.3 ± 1.4 vs 1.6 ± 1.3, P = .0252, respectively). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline in the T/T group tended to be higher than those in the M/T group, but the differences were not significant. No genotype-dependent difference in energy expenditure or outcome of weight reduction therapy was observed with respect to AGT M235T polymorphism. After the diet and exercise therapy, the blood pressure in the T/T group tended to be higher than that in the M/T group, but the difference was not significant. We demonstrated that the T/T genotype of the AGT M235T gene polymorphism was positively related to visceral obesity and hyperinsulinemia in obese Japanese women. Blood pressure did not show genotype-specific differences before or after the treatment. Further studies of the association between obesity and this gene polymorphism should contribute to understanding and treating obesity-related diseases. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) are critical for using learned representations of outcomes to guide behavior. Neurophysiological findings suggest complementary roles in which the BLA acquires associations between cues and outcomes and the OFC subsequently uses them to guide behavior. Here, we have used a reinforcer devaluation paradigm to test this hypothesis. In this paradigm, rats are first trained to associate a light conditioned stimulus (CS) with a food outcome, and then the food is devalued by pairing it with illness. After this devaluation procedure, responding to the CS is assessed in a single probe session. Previously, we have shown that BLA and OFC lesions made before training do not affect the acquisition of conditioned responding but do impair the sensitivity of that responding to reinforcer devaluation. Rats with such lesions fail to exhibit the spontaneous decrease in conditioned responding to the light cue observed in controls in the probe test. Here, we have extended those findings by showing that performance in the probe test is impaired by OFC lesions made after light-food conditioning but not by BLA lesions made after that training. These findings indicate that the OFC and BLA play different roles in mediating normal goal-directed performance in this, and likely other, settings. The BLA seems critical to forming representations linking cues to the incentive properties of outcomes but not for maintaining these representations in memory, updating them with new information, or for expressing them in behavior. In contrast, the OFC seems essential for one or more of these latter processes.},

Design/subjects/intervention: In a 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial with clinic visits at month 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12, a total of 312 Japanese men (n=174) and women (n=138) (aged 22 to 73 years) with body mass index (calculated as kg/m
                        2) ???25 and/or fasting serum triglyceride level ???150 mg/dL (1.70 mmol/L) (aged 22 to 73 years) were randomly assigned to the diacylglycerol (n=155) or triacylglycerol (n=157) group. Participants substituted their usual home cooking oil with the assigned test oils. Main outcome measures: Changes in anthropometrics and serum triglyceride level were monitored at 3-month intervals across a 12-month period. Results: In the intention-to-treat analysis, body weight decreased significantly in the diacylglycerol group when compared to the triacylglycerol group (P=0.013). Changes in body weight and body mass index during the study period differed between the two groups by 0.87 kg (P=0.002) and 0.32 kg (P=0.002), respectively. Participants with higher initial body mass index or greater percentage of total fat intake as diacylglycerol exhibited greater reduction in body weight. Total energy intake and physical activity were not significantly different between the groups during the study. Serum triglyceride levels decreased significantly from values in individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, but did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Modest body weight reduction was observed after 1-year ad libitum consumption of diacylglycerol oil as part of a regular diet in comparison to that of triacylglycerol oil; weight loss was greatest in participants who were obese at baseline. The weight reduction observed in diacylglycerol group was attributed to the substitution of usual home cooking oil with diacylglycerol, because total energy intake and physical activity did not differ between groups. ?? 2008 American Dietetic Association.},

abstract = {Background It is known that obesity, sodium in- take, and alcohol consumption influence blood pres- sure. In this clinical trial, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, we assessed the effects of dietary pat- terns on blood pressure. Methods We enrolled 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg. For three weeks, the subjects were fed a control diet that was low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat con- tent typical of the average diet in the United States. They were then randomly assigned to receive for eight weeks the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or a “combination” diet rich in fruits, veg- etables, and low-fat dairy products and with reduced saturated and total fat. Sodium intake and body weight were maintained at constant levels. Results At base line, the mean ( ? SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131.3 ? 10.8 mm Hg and 84.7 ? 4.7 mm Hg, respectively. The combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg more, respectively, than the con- trol diet (P ? 0.001 for each); the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.8 mm Hg more (P ? 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more (P ? 0.07) than the control diet. Among the 133 subjects with hypertension (systolic pres- sure, ? 140 mm Hg; diastolic pressure, ? 90 mm Hg; or both), the combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P ? 0.001 for each); among the 326 subjects without hyperten- sion, the corresponding reductions were 3.5 mm Hg (P ? 0.001) and 2.1 mm Hg (P ? 0.003). Conclusions A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and with reduced saturated and total fat can substantially lower blood pressure. This diet offers an additional nutritional approach to pre- venting and treating hypertension. (N Engl J Med 1997;336:1117-24.)},

abstract = {UNLABELLED We examined ethnic difference in the association of body fat and trunk fat with bone mineral density (BMD) among Chinese, white, and black subjects. We found that, with greater body and trunk fat, both white and black subjects were more likely to have a low BMD than Chinese subjects. INTRODUCTION Ethnic differences in body fat, abdominal fat distribution, and BMD have been found in previous studies between Chinese and white subjects. However, the associations of body fat and abdominal fat distribution with BMD have not been studied, and whether the ethnic differences have an effect on these associations is unclear. METHODS We evaluated 1,147 subjects aged ≥ 18 years (805 Chinese, 193 whites, and 149 blacks). Percent body fat ({\%}BF), percent trunk fat ({\%}TF), and total and regional BMD including that of head, arm, leg, trunk, rib, spine, and pelvis were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression models were developed to test the association of ethnicity, {\%}BF, and interaction between ethnicity and {\%}BF with BMD. The models were repeated again, replacing {\%}BF with {\%}TF. RESULTS Chinese subjects showed lower BMD in total and most regions compared with black and white subjects; however, these differences were eliminated between Chinese and whites within both sexes and between Chinese and black men when age, weight, height, and {\%}BF were added. {\%}BF and {\%}TF were negatively associated with most regional body BMD. The interactions between {\%}BF, {\%}TF, and ethnicity were found in most regional body BMD among Chinese, white, and black subjects for both men and women. CONCLUSION Both {\%}BF and {\%}TF have negative associations with BMD. With greater accumulation of {\%}BF and {\%}TF, both white and black subjects may experience a higher risk of low BMD than Chinese subjects.},

abstract = {Geometry in the simplex has been developed in the last 15 years mainly based on the contributions due to J. Aitchison. The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

To reduce the effect of boundary geometry errors in imaging abdominal fat, we develop a depth-based reconstruction method that uses a specially chosen current pattern to construct reference-like data, which are then used to identify the border between subcutaneous fat and muscle. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulations using 32-channel EIT system and a humanlike domain.},

abstract = {Human brain imaging studies demonstrate distributed activation of limbic, paralimbic and sensory systems to food and food-associated cues. Activity in this circuit may be modulated by internal factors, such as hunger, and cognitive factors. Anticipation to eat is one such factor, which likely impacts consummatory behavior. Here, the neural substrates of food expectancy were identified in 10 healthy male participants who underwent two whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans on separate days. Fasted subjects viewed images of food and scenery, in two counterbalanced states. During one condition, subjects were 'expecting' to eat right after the scan and during the other they were 'not expecting' to eat for 1. h after the scan. Food pictures compared with scenery yielded bilateral activation in visual areas as well as in the left insula and amygdala in both conditions. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and putamen were additionally activated in the 'not expecting' condition while right orbitofrontal cortex activity was enhanced in the 'expecting' condition. These data suggest that cognitive manipulations affect the response to food cues in the prefrontal cortex, in areas involved in the planning and control of motivated behaviors, while the amygdala and insula responded equally in both conditions, consistent with a more basic role in homeostatically driven appetitive behavior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Data were derived from published studies that included mean values for AVF and ASF areas, measured using computed tomography, and age for native Japanese, African-Americans, and Caucasians of both genders. Mean values from each study were used as single data points. A significant difference in AVF was observed between Japanese and Caucasian populations after adjusting for ASF, age, and sex ( p{\textless}0.05). However, the difference in AVF between Japanese and Caucasian females was lower than that between African-American and Caucasian females.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The circulating levels of ?-carotene are modulated not only by sex, but also by autosomal gene variations and fruit intake. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactions between ?-carotene metabolism-related gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; genetic factors) and nutrient intake (environmental factors) relating to their effects on circulating ?-carotene. The serum concentrations of ?-carotene and the habitual food intake of 92 healthy Japanese adults were examined. All subjects were genotyped for three common SNPs: rs6564851 in the ?-carotene 15,150 -oxygenase 1 (BCO1) gene, rs2278986 in the scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) gene and rs362090 in the intestine-specific homeobox (ISX) gene. Univariate analysis revealed that the circulating ?-carotene levels were significantly higher in rs6564851 GG homozygotes (p = 0.003). Additionally, the daily intake of ?-cryptoxanthin was positively associated with the circulating ?-carotene levels in female GG homozygotes of rs6564851 (p = 0.023), and the daily intake of ?- and ?-carotenes, and ?-cryptoxanthin was significantly lower in female rs6564851 T allele carries than in female GG homozygotes (p = 0.009, 0.008, 0.009, respectively). The present study apparently indicates that higher circulating ?-carotene levels in female rs6564851 GG homozygotes depensd on carotenoid intake.},

abstract = {A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term "SR image reconstruction" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term "super" in "super resolution" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. Before presenting the review of existing SR algorithms, we first model the LR image acquisition process.},

abstract = {Complementary neuronal recordings and functional neuroimaging in humans, show that the primary taste cortex in the anterior insula provides separate and combined representations of the taste, temperature and texture (including fat texture) of food in the mouth independently of hunger and thus of reward value and pleasantness. One synapse on, in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), these sensory inputs are for some neurons combined by learning with olfactory and visual inputs, and these neurons encode food reward in that they only respond to food when hungry, and in that activations correlate with subjective pleasantness. Cognitive factors, including word-level descriptions, and attention, modulate the representation of the reward value of food in the OFC. Further, there are individual differences in the representation of the reward value of food in the OFC. It is argued that overeating and obesity are related in many cases to an increased reward value of the sensory inputs produced by foods, and their modulation by cognition and attention, which overrides existing satiety signals. It is proposed that control of all rather than one or several of these factors that influence food reward and eating may be important in the prevention and treatment of overeating and obesity.},

There was a significant difference in total and regional fat mass among the three groups (P {\textless} 0.05). Lean mass of legs and total lean mass showed a significant difference between the thin group and the obese group (P {\textless} 0.05). The results showed that obesity was associated with higher BMD of weight bearing-bones and ribs, high total and regional fat mass, and high lean mass of bilateral legs and total lean mass. We suggest that obesity may contribute to the prevention of bone loss of weight-bearing bones and ribs and muscular atrophy of the legs.},

abstract = {Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies derived Dietary Reference Values for vitamin A. The Panel considered that a concentration of 20 $\mu$g retinol/g liver can be used as a target for establishing the Average Requirement (AR) for vitamin A. In the absence of a better characterisation of the relationship between vitamin A intake and liver stores, a factorial approach was applied. This approach considered a total body/liver retinol store ratio of 1.25, a liver/body weight ratio of 2.4 {\%}, a fractional catabolic rate of body retinol of 0.7 {\%} per day, an efficiency of storage in the whole body for ingested retinol of 50 {\%} and reference weights for women and men in the EU of 58.5 and 68.1 kg, respectively. ARs of 570 $\mu$g retinol equivalent (RE)/day for men and 490 $\mu$g RE/day for women were derived. Assuming a coefficient of variation (CV) of 15 {\%}, Population Reference Intakes (PRIs) of 750 $\mu$g RE/day for men and 650 $\mu$g RE/day for women were set. For infants aged 7–11 months and children, the same equation as for adults was applied by using specific values for reference weight and liver/body weight ratio. For catabolic rate, the adult value corrected on the basis of a growth factor was used. ARs range from 190 $\mu$g RE/day in infants aged 7–11 months to 580 $\mu$g RE/day in boys aged 15–17 years. PRIs for infants and children were estimated using a CV of 15 {\%} and range from 250 to 750 $\mu$g RE/day. For pregnancy and lactation, additional vitamin A requirements related to the accumulation of retinol in fetal and maternal tissues and transfer of retinol into breast milk were considered and PRIs of 700 and 1 300 $\mu$g RE/day, respectively, were set.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the body fat distribution and fat cell size and number in an overweight/obese population from both genders, and to determine the possible relationship between fat cell data from three different adipose tissue localizations (subcutaneous (SA), perivisceral and omental) and adipose tissue composition and dietary fatty acid. DESIGN: The sample consisted of 84 overweight/obese patients (29 men and 55 women) who have undergone abdominal surgery. The adipocyte size and total fat cell number was studied. Fat cell data were related with anthropometric, adipose tissue and subject's habitual diet fatty acid composition. MEASUREMENTS: Fat cell size was measured according to a Sj{\"{o}}str{\"{o}}m method from the three adipose depots. Total fat cell number was also calculated. The fatty acid composition of adipose tissue was examined by gas chromatography. The subjects diet was studied by a 7 days dietary record. RESULTS: Our data showed a negative relationship between the adipocyte size and the n-6 and n-3 fatty acids content of the SA adipose tissue (r=-0.286, P=0,040; r=-0.300, P=0.030) respectively, and the n-6 in the omental depots (r=-0.407, P=0.049) in the total population. Positive associations with the total of saturated (r=0.357, P=0.045) and negative (r=-0.544, P=0.001) with the n-9 fatty acids were observed when the relationship between the adipocyte number and the fatty acid composition of the different anatomical fat regions was studied. Dietary fatty acids composition positively correlated with fat cell size for the myristic acid (14:0) in men in the visceral depot (r=0.822, P=0.023), and for the saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in women in the omental depot (r=0.486, P=0.035). CONCLUSION: In the present study, for the first time in humans we found that n-3 and n-6 fatty acids are related to a reduced adipocyte size according to the depot localization. In contrast, adipose tissue and dietary SFAs significantly correlated with an increase in fat cell size and number. No significant associations were found between n-9 acids content and adipocyte size. However, n-9 adipose tissue fatty acids content was inversely associated with fat cell number showing that this type of fatty acid could limit hyperplasia in obese populations. The differences observed in the three different regions, perivisceral, omental and SA fat, indicate that this population adipose tissue have depot-specific differences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Weight suppression, which reflects the difference between the highest previous weight and current weight, has predicted future increases in body mass index (BMI) and bulimic pathology; however, the mechanisms underlying these predictive effects are unclear. OBJECTIVE: The current study sought to test whether weight suppression predicts future increases in BMI and bulimic symptoms and whether suppressed resting metabolic rate (RMR) and suppressed total energy expenditure (TEE) drive these relations. DESIGN: A randomly selected subsample of 91 young women in their first year of college with body image concerns completed an RMR assessment--a doubly labeled water assessment of TEE--and provided data on weight suppression and change in BMI and bulimic symptoms over a 6-mo follow-up period. RESULTS: Weight suppression predicted future increases in BMI and correlated inversely with suppressed RMR and TEE, yet this predictive effect did not decrease when suppressed RMR and TEE were controlled for. Weight suppression, however, did not predict future increases in bulimic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide additional evidence that weight suppression predicts future increases in BMI but not in bulimic symptoms. Weight suppression showed moderate relations with suppressed RMR and TEE, but these variables do not appear to drive the predictive effect on future increases in BMI.},

CONCLUSION:$\backslash$nThese results suggest that there is a significant risk associated$\backslash$nwith low blood pressure levels, which can be determined by ambulatory$\backslash$nand home blood pressure measurements, but not by casual blood pressure$\backslash$nmeasurements.},

The larg- est segment within the organic market is fresh produce, compris- ing 34{\%} percent of retail sales in 2006. This analysis focuses on identifying the demographic characteristics of households buying organic vegetables (in total) along with prepackaged organic salads and organic carrots, by examining the factors that influ- ence the probability that a consumer will buy organic vegetables, and which factors influence the household share of organic vege- tables purchased.

Despite the potential biopharmacological properties attributed to these compounds, little is known about their bioavailability in humans. In this study, we evaluated the distribution profile of the major CGA isomers and metabolites in plasma and urine of 6 healthy adults for 4 h after brewed coffee consumption. Three CQA isomers and 3 diCQA isomers were identified in the plasma of all subjects after coffee consumption, whereas 2 FQA were identified in only 1 subject. Two plasma concentration peaks were observed, the first at 0.5-1.0 h and the second at 1.5-4.0 h after coffee consumption. The molar ratio CQA:diCQA was 12.2 in the brewed coffee, whereas in plasma it ranged from 0.6-2.9. The molar ratios 5-CQA:3-CQA and 5-CQA:4-CQA were consistently higher in plasma than in the brew. The main CGA metabolites identified in urine after coffee consumption were: dihydrocaffeic, gallic, isoferulic, ferulic, vanillic, caffeic, 5-CQA, sinapic, rho-hydroxybenzoic, and rho-coumaric acids (gallic and dihydrocaffeic acids being the major ones). This study indicates that the major CGA compounds present in coffee are differentially absorbed and/or metabolized in humans, with a large inter-individual variation. Moreover, urine does not appear to be a major excretion pathway of intact CGA compounds in humans.},

abstract = {Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that an increased intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids protects against mortality from coronary artery disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that long-term use of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is effective for prevention of major coronary events in hypercholesterolaemic patients in Japan who consume a large amount of fish. Methods: 18 645 patients with a total cholesterol of 6{\textperiodcentered}5 mmol/L or greater were recruited from local physicians throughout Japan between 1996 and 1999. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1800 mg of EPA daily with statin (EPA group; n=9326) or statin only (controls; n=9319) with a 5-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was any major coronary event, including sudden cardiac death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and other non-fatal events including unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, stenting, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00231738. Findings: At mean follow-up of 4{\textperiodcentered}6 years, we detected the primary endpoint in 262 (2{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) patients in the EPA group and 324 (3{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}) in controls-a 19{\%} relative reduction in major coronary events (p=0{\textperiodcentered}011). Post-treatment LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased 25{\%}, from 4{\textperiodcentered}7 mmol/L in both groups. Serum LDL cholesterol was not a significant factor in a reduction of risk for major coronary events. Unstable angina and non-fatal coronary events were also significantly reduced in the EPA group. Sudden cardiac death and coronary death did not differ between groups. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease who were given EPA treatment, major coronary events were reduced by 19{\%} (secondary prevention subgroup: 158 [8{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}] in the EPA group vs 197 [10{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}] in the control group; p=0{\textperiodcentered}048). In patients with no history of coronary artery disease, EPA treatment reduced major coronary events by 18{\%}, but this finding was not significant (104 [1{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}] in the EPA group vs 127 [1{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}] in the control group; p=0{\textperiodcentered}132). Interpretation: EPA is a promising treatment for prevention of major coronary events, and especially non-fatal coronary events, in Japanese hypercholesterolaemic patients. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {AbstrAct background Alcohol control policy has a fundamental role in limiting negative health, economic and social harm caused by alcohol consumption. However, there is substantial international heterogeneity in country-level policy adoption, implementation and monitoring. Comparative measures so far focused on Europe or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Methods We created an Alcohol Control Policy Index (ACPI) for 167 countries using five different methodological approaches. National policies were sourced from WHO's Global Information System on Alcohol and Health. We assessed ACPI's criterion-related validity by calculating the strength of the association among the different approaches. As for content validity, we tested whether the resulting scores explained variations in alcohol per capita consumption cross-nationally, controlling for gross domestic product, population age, urbanisation and world region using OLS and random coefficients models. results Index scores and ranks from different methodological approaches are highly correlated (r=0.99). Higher scores were associated with lower consumption across the five methods. For each 1 score increase in the ACPI, the reduction in per capita alcohol consumption varies from −0.024 L (95{\%} CI (−0.043 to −0.004) to −0.014 L (95{\%} CI (−0.034 to 0.005). We obtain larger coefficients and p values {\textless}0.005 when estimating random coefficients. conclusion ACPI offers a measure of alcohol control policy across countries that makes use of a larger number of countries than its predecessors, as well as a wider range of methodologies for its calculation, both of which contribute to its validity. Furthermore, it shows that the statutory strictness of alcohol control policies is associated with lower levels of alcohol consumption.},

abstract = {Long-term caloric restriction (CR) is a robust means of reducing age-related diseases and extending life span in multiple species, but the effects in humans are unknown. The low caloric intake, long life expectancy, and the high prevalence of centenarians in Okinawa have been used as an argument to support the CR hypothesis in humans. However, no long-term, epidemiologic analysis has been conducted on traditional dietary patterns, energy balance, and potential CR phenotypes for the specific cohort of Okinawans who are purported to have had a calorically restricted diet. Nor has this cohort's subsequent mortality experience been rigorously studied. Therefore, we investigated six decades of archived population data on the elderly cohort of Okinawans (aged 65-plus) for evidence of CR. Analyses included traditional diet composition, energy intake, energy expenditure, anthropometry, plasma DHEA, mortality from age-related diseases, and current survival patterns. Findings include low caloric intake and negative energy balance at younger ages, little weight gain with age, life-long low BMI, relatively high plasma DHEA levels at older ages, low risk for mortality from age-related diseases, and survival patterns consistent with extended mean and maximum life span. This study lends epidemiologic support for phenotypic benefits of CR in humans and is consistent with the well-known literature on animals with regard to CR phenotypes and healthy aging.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a method for reconstructing a three-dimensional image of the conductivity distribution in a target volume using magnetic resonance (MR). In MREIT, currents are applied to the volume through surface electrodes and their effects on the MR induced magnetic fields are analyzed to produce the conductance image. However, current injection through surface electrodes poses technical problems such as the limitation on the safely applicable currents. In this paper, we present a new method called magnetic resonance driven electrical impedance tomography (MRDEIT), where the magnetic resonance in each voxel is used as the applied magnetic field source, and the resultant electromagnetic field is measured through surface electrodes or radio-frequency (RF) detectors placed near the surface. Because the applied magnetic field is at the RF frequency and eddy currents are the integral components in the method, a vector wave equation for the electric field is used as the basis of the analysis instead of a quasi-static approximation. Using computer simulations, it is shown that complex permittivity images can be reconstructed using MRDEIT, but that improvements in signal detection are necessary for detecting moderate complex permittivity changes.},

abstract = {The central role of the hypothalamus in the origination and/or processing of feeding-related stimuli may be modulated by the activity of other functional areas of the brain including the insular cortex (involved in enteroceptive monitoring) and the prefrontal cortex (involved in the inhibition of inappropriate response tendencies). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a marker of neuronal activity, was measured in 11 healthy, normal-weight men by using positron emission tomography in a state of hunger (after 36-h fast) and a state of satiation (after a liquid meal). Hunger was associated with significantly increased rCBF in the vicinity of the hypothalamus and insular cortex and in additional paralimbic and limbic areas (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal and hippocampal formation), thalamus, caudate, precuneus, putamen, and cerebellum. Satiation was associated with increased rCBF in the vicinity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Changes in plasma insulin concentrations in response to the meal were negatively correlated with changes in rCBF in the insular and orbitofrontal cortex. Changes in plasma free fatty acid concentrations in response to the meal were negatively correlated with changes in rCBF in the anterior cingulate and positively correlated with changes in rCBF in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, these findings raise the possibility that several regions of the brain participate in the regulation of hunger and satiation and that insulin and free fatty acids may be metabolic modulators of postprandial brain neuronal events. Although exploratory, the present study provides a foundation for investigating the human brain regions and cognitive operations that respond to nutritional stimuli.},

In this paper approaches for the development of an in silico mutagenicity screening tool are described. Three individual in silico models, which cover both structure activity relationship methods (SARs) and quantitative structure activity relationship methods (QSARs), were built using three different modelling techniques: (1) an in-house alert model: which uses SAR approach where alerts are generated based on experts judgements; (2) a kNN approach (k-Nearest Neighbours), which is a QSAR model where a prediction is given based on outcomes of its k chemical neighbours; (3) a naive Bayesian model (NB), which is another QSAR model, where a prediction is derived using a Bayesian formula through preselected identified informative chemical features (e.g., physico-chemical, structural descriptors). These in silico models, were compared against two well-known alert models (DEREK and ToxTree) and also against three different consensus approaches (Categorical Bayesian Integration Approach (CBI), Partial Least Squares Discriminate Analysis (PLS-DA) and simple majority vote approach). By applying these integration methods on the validation sets it was shown that both integration models (PLS-DA and CBI) achieved better performance than any of the individual models or consensus obtained by simple majority rule. In conclusion, the recommendation of this paper is that when obtaining consensus predictions for Ames mutagenicity, approaches like PLS-DA or CBI should be the first choice for the integration as compared to a simple majority vote approach.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Sarcopenia, decreased muscle volume and muscle weakness in the elderly is a serious risk of various adverse outcomes. Current diagnostic procedure for sarcopenia includes gait speed, grip strength, and percentage of skeletal muscle volume. However, lower leg muscle strength decreases much faster than grasp power, and we have evaluated the usefulness of its measurement using a recently developed instrument (Locomoscan). 

METHODS
Forty-three institutionalized elderly subjects were evaluated for their anthropometrical parameters, body composition, grasp and lower leg muscle strength, and gait speed. They were categorized into 2 groups; gait speed equal to or higher than 0.8 m/s and that below 0.8 m/s. 

RESULTS
Leg muscle strength per body weight was significantly greater in those with their gait speed equal to or higher than 0.8 m/s, whereas there was no significant difference in other parameters. Receiver operator characteristics analysis has shown that leg muscle alone significantly predicted the greater gait speed. 

CONCLUSIONS
Lower leg muscle strength can be useful for predicting gait speed.},

Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90{\%} lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg, or {\textless}130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce$\backslash$nblood pressure and urine protein excretion and slow the progression$\backslash$nof chronic kidney disease. PURPOSE: To determine the levels of blood$\backslash$npressure and urine protein excretion associated with the lowest risk$\backslash$nfor progression of chronic kidney disease during antihypertensive$\backslash$ntherapy with and without ACE inhibitors. DATA SOURCES: 11 randomized,$\backslash$ncontrolled trials comparing the efficacy of antihypertensive regimens$\backslash$nwith or without ACE inhibitors for patients with predominantly nondiabetic$\backslash$nkidney disease. STUDY SELECTION: MEDLINE database search for English-language$\backslash$nstudies published between 1977 and 1999. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on$\backslash$n1860 nondiabetic patients were pooled in a patient-level meta-analysis.$\backslash$nProgression of kidney disease was defined as a doubling of baseline$\backslash$nserum creatinine level or onset of kidney failure. Multivariable$\backslash$nregression analysis was performed to assess the association of systolic$\backslash$nand diastolic blood pressure and urine protein excretion with kidney$\backslash$ndisease progression at 22 610 patient visits. DATA SYNTHESIS: Mean$\backslash$nduration of follow-up was 2.2 years. Kidney disease progression was$\backslash$ndocumented in 311 patients. Systolic blood pressure of 110 to 129$\backslash$nmm Hg and urine protein excretion less than 2.0 g/d were associated$\backslash$nwith the lowest risk for kidney disease progression. Angiotensin-converting$\backslash$nenzyme inhibitors remained beneficial after adjustment for blood$\backslash$npressure and urine protein excretion (relative risk, 0.67 [95{\%} CI,$\backslash$n0.53 to 0.84]). The increased risk for kidney progression at higher$\backslash$nsystolic blood pressure levels was greater in patients with urine$\backslash$nprotein excretion greater than 1.0 g/d (P {\textless} 0.006). CONCLUSION: Although$\backslash$nreverse causation cannot be excluded with certainty, a systolic blood$\backslash$npressure goal between 110 and 129 mm Hg may be beneficial in patients$\backslash$nwith urine protein excretion greater than 1.0 g/d. Systolic blood$\backslash$npressure less than 110 mm Hg may be associated with a higher risk$\backslash$nfor kidney disease progression.},

abstract = {X-ray phase-contrast tomography (PCT) methods seek to quantitatively reconstruct separate images that depict an object's absorption and refractive contrasts. Most PCT reconstruction algorithms generally operate by explicitly or implicitly performing the decoupling of the projected absorption and phase properties at each tomographic view angle by use of a phase-retrieval formula. However, the presence of zero-frequency singularity in the Fourier-based phase retrieval formulas will lead to a strong noise amplification in the projection estimate and the subsequent refractive image obtained using conventional algorithms like filtered backprojection (FBP). Tomographic reconstruction by use of statistical methods can account for the noise model and a priori information, and thereby can produce images with better quality over conventional filtered backprojection algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate an iterative image reconstruction method that exploits the second-order statistical properties of the projection data can mitigate noise amplification in PCT. The autocovariance function of the reconstructed refractive images was empirically computed and shows smaller and shorter noise correlation compared to those obtained using the FBP and unweighted penalized least-squares methods. Concepts from statistical decision theory are applied to demonstrate that the statistical properties of images produced by our method can improve signal detectability.},

Some basic properties of neural activity in the cerebral cortex in response to electrogustatory stimulation were revealed by measuring magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals with a whole-cortex-type system in response to varying intensities of anodal DC currents focally applied to the tongue surface in human subjects. Independent component analysis was used to eliminate stimulus artifacts in MEG signals. Electrogustatory stimulation with intensities of induced electric taste evoked responses bilaterally, mainly in the opercular-insular cortex with a mean onset latency of [{\~{}}]350 ms, while subthreshold electrogustatory stimulation induced modest responses in the cortex. Stronger stimulation induced a tingling sensation and elicited large transient responses in both the opercular-insular and somatic sensory cortices.

abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that the hypothalamic control system of food intake involves many feeding-related neuropeptides. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), one of a group of potent orexigenic peptides, is exclusively produced in neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area that give off fibers to the widespread brain regions. The receptor of MCH was recently identified to be localized in cell bodies and dendritic processes of particular neurons throughout the brain, in close spatial relation to MCH fibers. Leptin, an anorectic hormone secreted from the adipose tissue, acts on the specific receptor present on its target neurons in the brain, and suppresses the expression of both MCH and its receptor. Leptin receptor and STAT3, a transcription factor mediating the leptin signaling, are distributed in the widespread brain regions including the cerebral neocortex, hippocampal formation and lower brainstem as well as the hypothalamus where MCH fibers and the MCH receptor are abundantly present. These findings suggest that MCH exerts the effect through its specific receptor distributed throughout the brain and that the function of MCH is influenced by the condition of peripheral energy balance via leptin, the leptin receptor and STAT3, not only in the hypothalamus, but also in other brain regions. In the brain, MCH might be involved in various feeding-related functions, such as appetite, food-searching behavior, eating muscle movement, and control of energy balance, depending upon the physiological role of each region.},

At frequencies below 100 kHz a four-electrode technique was employed; at frequencies above 100 kHz a conventional two-electrode technique was used in conjunction with a commercial admittance bridge. All measurements were performed with the tissue sample at body temperature. Over the entire frequency range of the study, the dielectric properties of the muscle were found to be significantly anisotropic. At audio frequencies, the conductivity of the muscle measured in a direction parallel to the fibre orientation was typically found to be ten times higher than that measured perpendicular to the fibre axis; at frequencies approaching 1 MHz the conductivities measured in both directions approached a common value, near 8 ms cm{\&}{\#}8722;1. The dielectric permittivity in both orientations is strongly dependent on frequency. These data are analysed using the suspension equation, and comments are made on the mechanisms that are responsible for the observed properties.

abstract = {Isokinetic contraction is the muscular contraction that accompanies constant velocity limb movements around a joint. The velocity of movement is maintained constant by a special dynamometer. The resistance of the dynamometer is equal to the muscular forces applied throughout the range of movement. This method allows the measurement of the muscular forces in dynamic conditions and provides optimal loading of the muscles. However, during movements in the vertical plane, the torque registered by the dynamometer is the resultant torque produced by the muscular and gravitational forces. The error depends on the angular position and the torque potential of the tested muscle group. Several methods have been developed for the correction of gravitational errors in isokinetic data. The torque output also contains artefacts that are associated with the inertial forces during acceleration and deceleration periods before the development of the constant preset angular velocity. For an accurate assessment of muscle function, only constant velocity data should be analysed. The most frequently used isokinetic parameters are the maximum torque and the angular position where it was recorded, the torque output at different angular velocities of movement, the torque ratio of reciprocal muscle groups and the torque output during repeated contractions. The unique features of isokinetic dynamometry are optimal loading of the muscles in dynamic conditions and constant preselected velocity of movement. These features provide safety in the rehabilitation of patients with muscular and ligamentous injuries. Isokinetic dynamometry has also been used for the training of various muscle groups in order to improve the muscular performance in dynamic conditions. The movement velocity of different activities can be simulated during training in order to improve the training effect. Data acquisition and analysis have been improved by using computer systems interfaced to isokinetic dynamometers. Recently developed computer systems provide correction for gravitational and inertial errors, accurate computation of isokinetic parameters and real-time display of the torque output.},

Such reward-related consumption can result in caloric intake exceeding requirements and is considered a major culprit in the rapidly increasing rates of obesity in developed countries. Compared with homeostatic mechanisms of feeding, much less is known about how hedonic systems in brain influence food intake. Intriguingly, excessive consumption of palatable food can trigger neuroadaptive responses in brain reward circuitries similar to drugs of abuse. Furthermore, similar genetic vulnerabilities in brain reward systems can increase predisposition to drug addiction and obesity. Here, recent advances in our understanding of the brain circuitries that regulate hedonic aspects of feeding behavior will be reviewed. Also, emerging evidence suggesting that obesity and drug addiction may share common hedonic mechanisms will also be considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Objective: The objectives were to examine the feasibility of using white rice as a reference food in the study of glycemic index (GI) and to examine the GI values of both single and mixed meal foods among rice species, processed rice products, beans, and dairy products. Design: Subjects were served with 50g carbohydrate content of white rice at least two times (maximum three times) and test food once after separate overnight fasts. Capillary blood glucose measurements were carried out before and during 120min after each food load. Setting: The study was carried out in an outpatient setting. Subjects: A total of 58 (38 females and 20 males) nondiseased subjects, mean aged 37y and mean BMI22kg/m2 were included. Result: The correlation between incremental area under curve of white rice and glucose was r¼0.853 (n¼10, Po0.0001) and white rice was considered suitable to be used as a reference food. Among mixed meal foods, the combination of carbohydrate foods with vinegar, dairy products, and bean products significantly decreased the GI value of white rice of 20–40{\%}. The reduction of GI occurred whether the foods were taken together, before or after rice intake. GI of noodles such as udon, soba, and spaghetti showed low GI values. Conclusion: White rice could be used as a reference food in determining GI values of foods. A total of 32 single and mixed meal Japanese common food products were examined for their GI values.},

abstract = {This event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) study investigated BOLD signal change in response to a series of pure gustatory stimuli that varied in stimulus quality when subjects were hungry and sated with a nutritional pre-load. Group analyses showed significant differences in activation in the hunger minus satiety condition in response to sucrose, caffeine, saccharin, and citric acid within the thalamus, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. When examining the hunger and satiety conditions, activation varied as a function of stimulus, with the majority of the stimuli exhibiting significantly greater activation in the hunger state within the insula, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in contrast to decreased activation in the satiated state within the parahippocampus, hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate. Region of interest (ROI) analysis revealed two significant interactions, ROI by physiology and ROI by physiology by stimulus. In the satiety condition, the primary (inferior and superior insulae) and secondary (OFC 11 and OFC 47) taste regions exhibited significantly greater brain activation in response to all stimuli than regions involved in processing eating behavior (hypothalamus), affect (amygdala), and memory (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex). These same regions demonstrated significantly greater activation within the hunger condition than the satiety condition, with the exception of the superior insula. Furthermore, the patterns of activation differed as a function taste stimulus, with greater activation in response to sucrose than to the other stimuli. These differential patterns of activation suggest that the physiological states of hunger and satiety produce divergent activation in multiple brain areas in response to different pure gustatory stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

St.-Hil.) may be helpful in losing excessive weight and fat. The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated efficacy and safety of an extract from green mate in 60 overweight subjects aged 20-39. years during 6-weeks. Body composition was measured by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) at baseline and after 6. weeks. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and various safety parameters were monitored. After 6. weeks, subjects taking mate experienced a significantly greater reduction of percent of body fat (-0.3{\%} vs +0.6{\%}, p=0.04) and fat mass (-0.5 kg vs +0.2 kg, p=0.04) than placebo. No significant differences were observed in other measurements. No adverse events occurred and all safety parameters were within normal ranges during the study in both groups. Thus, taking green mate extract reduced body fat after 6. weeks, while the treatment was safe and well tolerated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Food intake is regulated by 2 complementary drives: the homeostatic and hedonic pathways. The homeostatic pathway controls energy balance by increasing the motivation to eat following depletion of energy stores. In contrast, hedonic or reward-based regulation can override the homeostatic pathway during periods of relative energy abundance by increasing the desire to consume foods that are highly palatable. In contrast to the consumption of food, the motivation to use drugs of abuse is mediated only by the reward pathway. In this article we review the extensive research that has identified several mechanisms by which repeated exposure to drugs of abuse alters neuronal function and increases the motivational incentive to obtain and use these substances. We then compare our current understanding of drug-induced changes in neuronal reward circuitry with what is known about the consequences of repeated consumption of highly palatable foods such as high-fat and high-sugar diets. Next, we discuss the normal homeostatic regulation of food intake, which is a unique aspect of food addiction. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications of these neuronal adaptations in the context of obesity and neuropsychiatric syndromes such as bulimia nervosa and Prader-Willi syndrome.},

abstract = {Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been used to estimate skeletal muscle mass, but its application in the elderly is not optimal. The accuracy of BIA may be influenced by the expansion of extracellular water (ECW) relative to muscle mass with aging. Multifrequency BIA (MFBIA) can evaluate the distribution between ECW and intracellular water (ICW), and thus may be superior to single-frequency BIA (SFBIA) to estimate muscle mass in the elderly. A total of 58 elderly participants aged 65-85 years were recruited. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was obtained from computed tomography scans at the mid-thigh. Segmental SFBIA and MFBIA were measured for the upper legs. An index of the ratio of ECW and ICW was calculated using MFBIA. The correlation between muscle CSA and SFBIA was moderate (r = 0.68), but strong between muscle CSA and MFBIA (r = 0.85). ECW/ICW index was significantly and positively correlated with age (P {\textless} 0.001). SFBIA tends to significantly overestimate muscle CSA in subjects who had relative expansion of ECW in the thigh segment (P {\textless} 0.001). This trend was not observed for MFBIA (P = 0.42). Relative expansion of ECW was observed in older participants. The relative expansion of ECW affects the validity of traditional SFBIA, which is lowered when estimating muscle CSA in the elderly. By contrast, MFBIA was not affected by water distribution in thigh segments, thus rendering the validity of MFBIA for estimating thigh muscle CSA higher than SFBIA in the elderly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An association between coffee drinking and reduced risk of liver cancer has been suggested by animal studies, but epidemiologic evidence of such an association in a high-risk population is lacking. We conducted a large-scale population-based cohort study of the association between coffee drinking and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Japanese population. METHODS: Newly diagnosed case patients (250 men and 84 women) with HCC were identified from a 10-year follow-up of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, which consists of 90,452 middle-aged and elderly Japanese subjects (43,109 men and 47,343 women). Case patients were grouped according to coffee intake and were stratified by hepatitis virus infection, sex, age, diet, lifestyle factors, and previous history of liver disease. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for HCC were calculated with Cox proportional-hazards modeling. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Subjects (men and women combined) who consumed coffee on a daily or almost daily basis had a lower HCC risk than those who almost never drank coffee (HR = 0.49 [95{\%} CI = 0.36 to 0.66]); risk decreased with the amount of coffee consumed (compared with nondrinkers, the HR for 1-2 cups per day = 0.52 [95{\%} CI = 0.38 to 0.73]; for 3-4 cups per day = 0.48 [95{\%} CI = 0.28 to 0.83]; for {\textgreater} or =5 cups per day = 0.24 [95{\%} CI = 0.08 to 0.77], P(trend) {\textless} .001). The risk of liver cancer in almost never drinkers in this population was 547.2 cases per 100,000 people over 10 years, but it was 214.6 cases per 100 000 people with drinking coffee on a daily basis. The inverse association persisted when the participants were stratified by lifestyle factors. Similar associations were observed when the analysis was restricted to hepatitis C virus-positive patients (all daily drinkers compared with nondrinkers: HR =0.57 [95{\%} CI = 0.37 to 0.86]), to hepatitis B virus-positive patients (HR = 0.60 [95{\%} CI = 0.31 to 1.18]) and to subjects with no past history of chronic liver disease (HR = 0.45 [95{\%} CI = 0.30 to 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: In the Japanese population, habitual coffee drinking may be associated with reduced risk of HCC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The influence of adiposity on upper-limb bone strength has rarely been studied in children, despite the high incidence of forearm fractures in this population. OBJECTIVE The objective was to compare the influence of muscle and fat tissues on bone strength between the upper and lower limbs in prepubertal children. DESIGN Bone mineral content, total bone cross-sectional area, cortical bone area (CoA), cortical thickness (CoTh) at the radius and tibia (4{\%} and 66{\%}, respectively), trabecular density (TrD), bone strength index (4{\%} sites), cortical density (CoD), stress-strain index, and muscle and fat areas (66{\%} sites) were measured by using peripheral quantitative computed tomography in 427 children (206 boys) aged 7-10 y. RESULTS Overweight children (n = 93) had greater values for bone variables (0.3-1.3 SD; P {\textless} 0.0001) than did their normal-weight peers, except for CoD 66{\%} and CoTh 4{\%}. The between-group differences were 21-87{\%} greater at the tibia than at the radius. After adjustment for muscle cross-sectional area, TrD 4{\%}, bone mineral content, CoA, and CoTh 66{\%} at the tibia remained greater in overweight children, whereas at the distal radius total bone cross-sectional area and CoTh were smaller in overweight children (P {\textless} 0.05). Overweight children had a greater fat-muscle ratio than did normal-weight children, particularly in the forearm (92 +/- 28{\%} compared with 57 +/- 17{\%}). Fat-muscle ratio correlated negatively with all bone variables, except for TrD and CoD, after adjustment for body weight (r = -0.17 to -0.54; P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Overweight children had stronger bones than did their normal-weight peers, largely because of greater muscle size. However, the overweight children had a high proportion of fat relative to muscle in the forearm, which is associated with reduced bone strength.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is capable of monitoring regional lung recruitment and lung collapse during a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trial. DESIGN: Experimental animal study of acute lung injury. SUBJECT: Six pigs with saline-lavage-induced acute lung injury. INTERVENTIONS: An incremental and decremental PEEP trial at ten pressure levels was performed. Ventilatory, gas exchange, and hemodynamic parameters were automatically recorded. EIT and computed tomography (CT) scans of the same slice were simultaneously taken at each PEEP level. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A significant correlation between EIT and CT analyses of end-expiratory gas volumes (r=0.98 up to 0.99) and tidal volumes (r=0.55 up to r=0.88) could be demonstrated. Changes in global and regional tidal volumes and arterial oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) demonstrated recruitment/derecruitment during the trial, but at different onsets. During the decremental trial, derecruitment first occurred in dependent lung areas. This was indicated by lowered regional tidal volumes measured in this area and by a decrease of PaO2/FiO2. At the same time, the global tidal volume still continued to increase, because the increase of ventilation of the non-dependent areas was higher than the loss in the dependent areas. This indicates that opposing regional changes might cancel each other out when combined in a global parameter. CONCLUSIONS: EIT is suitable for monitoring the dynamic effects of PEEP variations on the regional change of tidal volume. It is superior to global ventilation parameters in assessing the beginning of alveolar recruitment and lung collapse.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been extensive discussion of the apparent conflict between meta-analyses and a mega-trial investigating the benefits of intravenous magnesium following myocardial infarction, in which the early trial results have been said to be 'too good to be true'. METHODS: We apply Bayesian methods of meta-analysis to the trials available before and after the publication of the ISIS-4 results. We show how scepticism can be formally incorporated into an analysis as a Bayesian prior distribution, and how Bayesian meta-analysis models allow appropriate exploration of hypotheses that the treatment effect depends on the size of the trial or the risk in the control group. RESULTS: Adoption of a sceptical prior would have led early enthusiasm for magnesium to be suitably tempered, but only if combined with a random effects meta-analysis, rather than the fixed effect analysis that was actually conducted. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that neither a fixed effect nor a random effects analysis is appropriate when the mega-trial is included. The Bayesian framework provides many possibilities for flexible exploration of clinical hypotheses, but there can be considerable sensitivity to apparently innocuous assumptions.},

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

abstract = {Background: Among adults, obesity has been positively related to bone mineral density. However, recent findings have pointed out that abdominal obesity could be negatively related to bone density. The above mentioned relationship is not clear among pediatric populations. Therefore, this cross-sectional study analyzed the relationship between thickness of abdominal adipose tissue and bone mineral variables in sedentary obese children and adolescents.Methods: One hundred and seventy five obese children and adolescents (83 male and 92 female) with ages ranging from 6 to 16 years-old were analyzed. Bone mineral content and density were estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and ultrasound equipment which estimated the thickness of the abdominal adipose tissue. Pubertal stage was self-reported by the participants.Results: The mean age was 11.1 (SD = 2.6). Thickness of the abdominal adipose tissue was negatively related to bone mineral density (r = -0.17 [r95{\%}CI: -0.03;-0.32]), independent of gender, pubertal stage and other confounders ($\beta$ = -0.134 ± 0.042 [$\beta$95{\%}CI: -0.217; -0.050]).Conclusions: In sedentary obese children and adolescents abdominal obesity is negatively related to bone mineral density, suggesting a potential link between abdominal obesity and osteoporosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 J{\'{u}}nior et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between breakfast type, energy intake and body mass index (BMI). We hypothesized not only that breakfast consumption itself is associated with BMI, but that the type of food eaten at breakfast also affects BMI. METHODS: Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a large, population-based study conducted in the United States from 1988 to 1994, were analyzed for breakfast type, total daily energy intake, and BMI. The analyzed breakfast categories were "Skippers," "Meat/eggs," "Ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC)," "Cooked cereal," "Breads," "Quick Breads," "Fruits/vegetables," "Dairy," "Fats/sweets," and "Beverages." Analysis of covariance was used to estimate adjusted mean body mass index (BMI) and energy intake (kcal) as dependent variables. Covariates included age, gender, race, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and poverty index ratio. RESULTS: Subjects who ate RTEC, Cooked cereal, or Quick Breads for breakfast had significantly lower BMI compared to Skippers and Meat and Egg eaters (p {\textless} or = 0.01). Breakfast skippers and fruit/vegetable eaters had the lowest daily energy intake. The Meat and Eggs eaters had the highest daily energy intake and one of the highest BMIs. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides evidence that skipping breakfast is not an effective way to manage weight. Eating cereal (ready-to-eat or cooked cereal) or quick breads for breakfast is associated with significantly lower body mass index compared to skipping breakfast or eating meats and/or eggs for breakfast.},

abstract = {Menthol is thought to stimulate lacrimation via activation of cold-sensitive primary afferent neurons in the cornea. We evaluated a warm compress containing menthol as a potential treatment for dry eye by examining its effects on the tear film in healthy subjects (n = 20) and dry eye patients (n = 35). Disposable eyelid-warming steamers that either did (MH) or did not (HO) contain menthol were applied to one eye of each subject either once only for 10 min or repeatedly over 2 weeks. Single application of MH significantly increased tear meniscus volume (P = 8.6 × 10(-5), P = 1.3 × 10(-5)) and tear film breakup time (P = 0.006, P = 0.002) as well as improved meibum condition in healthy subjects and dry eye patients, respectively. Repeated application of MH significantly increased tear meniscus volume (P = 0.004, P = 1.7 × 10(-4)) and tear film breakup time (P = 0.037, P = 0.010) in healthy subjects and dry eye patients, respectively. Repeated application of MH thus induced persistent increases in tear fluid volume and tear film stability in dry eye patients, suggesting that repeated use of a warm compress containing menthol is a potential novel treatment for dry eye disease.},

abstract = {The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in affective and motivated behaviors. Damage to this region, which includes the orbitofrontal cortex as well as ventral sectors of medial PFC, causes profound changes in emotional and social behavior, including impairments in certain aspects of decision making. One reinforcement mechanism that may well contribute to these behaviors is conditioned reinforcement, whereby previously neutral stimuli in the environment, by virtue of their association with primary rewards, take on reinforcing value and come to support instrumental action. Conditioned reinforcers are powerful determinants of behavior and can maintain responding over protracted periods of time in the absence of and potentially in conflict with primary reinforcers. It has already been shown that conditioned reinforcement is dependent on the amygdala, and because the amygdala projects to both the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial PFC, the present study determined whether conditioned reinforcement was also dependent on one or the other of these prefrontal regions. Comparison of the behavioral effects of selective excitotoxic lesions of the PFC in the common marmoset revealed that orbitofrontal but not medial PFC lesions disrupted two distinct measures of conditioned reinforcement: (1) acquisition of a new response and (2) sensitivity to conditioned stimulus omission on a second-order schedule. In contrast, the orbitofrontal lesion did not affect sensitivity to primary reinforcement as measured by responding on a progressive-ratio schedule and a home cage consumption test. Together, these findings demonstrate the critical and specific involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex but not the medial PFC in conditioned reinforcement.},

This area is anatomically incorrect and internally inconsistent within the digital atlas software applications using their multiplanar cross-referencing tools. By cross-referencing the axial, sagittal, and coronal plates from the original printed atlas, we demonstrate that the discrepant area should be labeled middle frontal gyrus.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship of health risk behavior and disease in adulthood to the breadth of exposure to childhood emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, and household dysfunction during childhood has not previously been described. METHODS: A questionnaire about adverse childhood experiences was mailed to 13,494 adults who had completed a standardized medical evaluation at a large HMO; 9,508 (70.5{\%}) responded. Seven categories of adverse childhood experiences were studied: psychological, physical, or sexual abuse; violence against mother; or living with household members who were substance abusers, mentally ill or suicidal, or ever imprisoned. The number of categories of these adverse childhood experiences was then compared to measures of adult risk behavior, health status, and disease. Logistic regression was used to adjust for effects of demographic factors on the association between the cumulative number of categories of childhood exposures (range: 0-7) and risk factors for the leading causes of death in adult life. RESULTS: More than half of respondents reported at least one, and one-fourth reported {\textgreater} or = 2 categories of childhood exposures. We found a graded relationship between the number of categories of childhood exposure and each of the adult health risk behaviors and diseases that were studied (P or = 50 sexual intercourse partners, and sexually transmitted disease; and 1.4- to 1.6-fold increase in physical inactivity and severe obesity. The number of categories of adverse childhood exposures showed a graded relationship to the presence of adult diseases including ischemic heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, skeletal fractures, and liver disease. The seven categories of adverse childhood experiences were strongly interrelated and persons with multiple categories of childhood exposure were likely to have multiple health risk factors later in life. CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong graded relationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes of death in adults.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Recent studies have suggested that VAT negatively affects bone. However, MetS has also been associated with higher estradiol (E2) levels, which is bone protective. We therefore investigated the impact of VAT and E2 levels on bone density, structural parameters, and strength estimates. DESIGN A cross-sectional study was conducted in 72 obese men with MetS to investigate the impact of VAT and E2 levels on bone. METHODS Bone parameters were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and high-resolution peripheral QCT (HRpQCT) at lumbar spine, proximal femur, radius, and tibia. VAT volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sexual hormones were measured in blood samples. RESULTS Men with high VAT had a lower bone density at the hip (P{\textless}0.05), lower cortical thickness, and higher buckling ratio at femoral neck (FN) (P=0.008 and P=0.02), compared with men with low VAT, despite a similar body weight and BMI. Generally, E2 levels were low (median 43 pmol/l), and men with E2 levels below median had reduced bone density at lumbar spine (P=0.04), and impaired structural parameters at radius and tibia, compared with men with E2 levels above median. At the hip, VAT volume and E2 levels affected bone density independently and additively, and 50{\%} of men with high VAT and low E2 levels had osteopenia with significantly lower T-score at FN (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS High VAT and low E2 negatively affect bone in obese men with MetS. VAT and E2 affect bone density at the hip independently and additively, revealing an unexpected high prevalence of osteopenia in middle-aged men with MetS.},

abstract = {The metabolic syndrome, manifested by insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, is conceived to increase the risk for coronary heart disease and type II diabetes. Several studies have used factor analysis to explore its underlying structure among related risk variables but reported different results. Taking a hypothesis-testing approach, this study used confirmatory factor analysis to specify and test the factor structure of the metabolic syndrome. A hierarchical four-factor model, with an overarching metabolic syndrome factor uniting the insulin resistance, obesity, lipid, and blood pressure factors, was proposed and tested with 847 men who participated in the Normative Aging Study between 1987 and 1991. Simultaneous multigroup analyses were also conducted to test the stability of the proposed model across younger and older participants and across individuals with and without cardiovascular disease. The findings demonstrated that the proposed structure was well supported (comparative fit index = 0.97, root mean square error approximation = 0.06) and stable across subgroups. The metabolic syndrome was represented primarily by the insulin resistance and obesity factors, followed by the lipid factor, and, to a lesser extent, the blood pressure factor. This study provides an empirical foundation for conceptualizing and measuring the metabolic syndrome that unites four related components (insulin resistance, obesity, lipids, and blood pressure).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potential therapeutic target against obesity and diabetes through thermogenesis and substrate disposal with cold exposure. The role of BAT in energy metabolism under thermoneutral conditions, however, remains controversial. We assessed the contribution of BAT to energy expenditure (EE), particularly diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), and substrate utilization in human adults. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, BAT activity was evaluated in 21 men using (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) after cold exposure (19 °C). The subjects were divided into BAT-positive (n=13) and BAT-negative (n=8) groups according to the (18)F-FDG-PET/CT findings. Twenty-four hour EE, DIT, and respiratory quotient were measured using a whole-room indirect calorimeter at 27 °C. RESULTS Body composition, blood metabolites, and 24-h EE did not differ between groups. DIT ({\%}), calculated as DIT divided by total energy intake, however, was significantly higher in the BAT-positive group (BAT-positive: 9.7±2.5{\%}, BAT-negative: 6.5±4.0{\%}, P=0.03). The 24-h respiratory quotient was significantly lower (P=0.03) in the BAT-positive group (0.860±0.028) than in the BAT-negative group (0.889±0.024). CONCLUSION DIT and fat utilization were higher in BAT-positive subjects compared to BAT-negative subjects, suggesting that BAT has a physiologic role in energy metabolism.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 19 July 2016. doi:10.1038/ijo.2016.124.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Prevention, early detection and effective rehabilitation of dysphagia are important issues to be considered in an aging society. Previous studies have shown conflicting findings regarding the association between dysphagia and its potential risk factors, including age, malnutrition, oral conditions, lifestyle and medical history. Herein, we assessed the prevalence and association of dysphagia with potential risk factors in 50- to 79-year-old adults dwelling in a community in Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, there were 532 participants (185 males and 347 females). Participants who responded positively to the question "Do you sometimes choke on drinks/food such as tea and soup?" or those who presented with abnormal repetitive saliva swallowing test findings were diagnosed with dysphagia. The data collected from these participants included the following: number of teeth, occurrence of oral dryness, age, body mass index, serum albumin concentration, smoking, drinking and exercise habits, presence of diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and questions from the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS Dysphagia was observed in 33 males (17.8{\%}) and 76 females (21.9{\%}). To explore the effect of the potential risk factors on the prevalence of dysphagia, a model was built by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Using the forced entry method, oral dryness (odds ratio [OR] =3.683 and P=0.003 in males; OR =1.797 and P=0.032 in females) and the number of teeth (OR =0.946 and P=0.038 in males) were found to be significantly related to dysphagia. CONCLUSION This cross-sectional study demonstrated associations between oral conditions and dysphagia. Factors such as oral dryness and number of teeth may contribute to dysphagia more so than aging, lifestyle and comorbidity in community-dwelling adults over the age of 50.},

abstract = {Background: Visceral fat is considered important in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MS). Here, we developed a novel method for determining visceral fat by measuring liver–kidney space (LKS) on abdominal sonography and expanded its utilization in the elderly to predict MS. Methods: To assess the correlation between the LKS and MS, 317 consecutive outpatients scheduled for health evaluation were retrospective analyzed. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose levels, and lipid profiles were obtained following standard protocols. On sonography, the thickness of visceral fat between the liver and right kidney was measured. We also compared its accuracy to predict MS with sonographic fatty liver changes. A total of 72 elderly patients older than 65 years were evaluated (mean age: 66.02 [65–83]). Results: In the current study, LKS = 4 mm enabled a better prediction of MS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.626. The sensitivity and specificity for the presence of visceral fat to predict MS in the elderly were 0.58 and 0.73, respectively. The accuracy to predict MS was 68.1{\%} for the measurement of visceral fat compared with 59.6{\%} for sonographic fatty liver change in the elderly. Conclusion: Measuring LKS by sonography may be a practical method for evaluating visceral fat in the elderly and for predicting MS better than sonographic fatty liver changes. LKS was more associated with abdominal girth and BMI in the elderly from the study supporting the observation that LKS are well correlated with general adiposity.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine skeletal muscle cutpoints for identifying elevated physical disability risk in older adults. Subjects included 4,449 older ({\textgreater} or = 60 years) participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988-1994. Physical disability was assessed by questionnaire, and bioimpedance was used to estimate skeletal muscle, which was normalized for height. Receiver operating characteristics were used to develop the skeletal muscle cutpoints associated with a high likelihood of physical disability. Odds for physical disability were compared in subjects whose measures fell above and below these cutpoints. Skeletal muscle cutpoints of 5.76-6.75 and {\textless} or =5.75 kg/m2 were selected to denote moderate and high physical disability risk in women. The corresponding values in men were 8.51-10.75 and {\textless} or =8.50 kg/m2. Compared with women with low-risk skeletal muscle values, women with moderate- and high-risk skeletal muscle values had odds for physical disability of 1.41 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.97, 2.04) and 3.31 (95{\%} CI: 1.91, 5.73), respectively. The corresponding odds in men were 3.65 (95{\%} CI: 1.92, 6.94) and 4.71 (95{\%} CI: 2.28, 9.74). This study presents skeletal muscle cutpoints for physical disability risk in older adults. Future applications of these cutpoints include the comparison of morbidity risk in older persons with normal muscle mass and those with sarcopenia, the determination and comparison of sarcopenia prevalences, and the estimation of health-care costs attributable to sarcopenia.},

Dietary patterns were extracted by reduced rank regression with 6 depression-related nutrients as response variables. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of depressive symptoms adjusted for potential confounders. A dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of vegetables, mushrooms, seaweeds, soybean products, green tea, potatoes, fruits, and small fish with bones and a low intake of rice was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios of having depressive symptoms were 0.62 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.48-0.81) in the highest versus lowest tertiles of dietary score. Results suggest that adherence to a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and typical Japanese foods, including mushrooms, seaweeds, soybean products, and green tea, is associated with a lower probability of having depressive symptoms.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to establish adequate criteria for categorizing 'obesity disease' in Japan in relation to obesity-related complications. The subjects were 1,193 Japanese subjects (775 men, 418 women; age: 20-84 years old, body mass index (BMI): 14.9-56.4 kg/m(2)) including subjects undergoing a health examination and obese subjects visiting an obesity clinic. Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were determined by computed tomography (CT) at the umbilical level. Anthropometric parameters, including BMI, waist circumference (W), waist/hip circumference (W/H), ratio and waist circumference/body height (W/BH) ratio, were measured. Hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension were evaluated as obesity-related complications. The relationship between each parameter and the prevalence of the complications was investigated. The number of complications increased in accordance with BMI and the average value was greater than 1.0 at a BMI of 25. The best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for detecting subjects with multiple risk factors was a BMI of 25. BMI showed a close positive correlation with SFA (r=0.82), even for BMI {\textgreater} or =25 (r=0.77), but had a weaker correlation with VFA (r=0.54). The obese subjects with a BMI {\textgreater} or =25 had no correlation between BMI and VFA because of the wide individual variation of VFA. The number of disorders was greater than 1.0 at 100 cm(2) of VFA and the best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for determining subjects with multiple risk factors was 100 cm(2) of VFA. Between the simple anthropometric values and measurement of VFA, it was proven that W had the closest relationship with VFA in both men (r=0.68) and women (r=0.65). The regression line obtained from simple correlation analyses indicated that the W corresponding to 100 cm(2) of VFA was 84.4 cm in men and 92.5 cm in women. These data suggest that obesity is adequately specified as a BMI {\textgreater} or =25 in Japan where the prevalence and degree of obesity remains mild. It is reasonable to establish the cut-off point of VFA at 100 cm(2) as indicative of the risk of obesity-related disorders and a waist circumference of 85 cm in men and 90 cm in women approximates to this visceral fat mass.},

Most interpolators do not necessarily satisfy the constant sum and nonnegativity constraints of compositional data, nor take spatial structure into account. Therefore, compositional kriging is introduced as a straightforward extension of ordinary kriging that complies with these constraints. In two case studies, the performance of compositional kriging is compared with that of the additive logratio-transform. In the first case study, compositional kriging yielded significantly more accurate predictions than the additive logratio-transform, while in the second ease study the performances were comparable.},

Main OutCOMe Measure Incidence of coronary heart disease (n=7035) was self-reported, and related deaths were identified by searching National Death Index or through report of next of kin or postal authority. Cases were confirmed by medical records review. results Mean intake of SFAs accounted for 9.0-11.3{\%} energy intake over time, and was mainly composed of lauric acid (12:0), myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), and stearic acid (18:0; 8.8-10.7{\%} energy). Intake of 12:0, 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0 were highly correlated, with Spearman correlation coefficients between 0.38 and 0.93 (all P{\textless}0.001).

abstract = {The relationship between habitual coffee consumption and blood pressure was investigated in 9601 subjects (7506 men and 2095 women) who were office managers and employees, aged 18-65 years. Those who drank coffee had lower blood pressure levels than those who did not and the mean blood pressure levels decreased with increasing coffee consumption. In the men, blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) was highest in the non-coffee drinkers (130.0/83.0 mmHg) and lowest in those drinking greater than 5 cups/day (126.0/81.3 mmHg). Mean differences (+/- s.e.m.) corrected by analysis of covariance for age and body mass index (kg/m2) were: systolic -4.0 +/- 0.7 mmHg, P less than 0.0001; diastolic -1.7 +/- 0.5 mmHg, P less than 0.001. In the women, blood pressure ranged from 121.1/77.4 mmHg in the non-coffee drinkers to 117.7/76.2 mmHg in those drinking greater than 5 cups/day (mean +/- s.e.m. systolic difference -3.4 +/- 1.4 mmHg, P less than 0.05; diastolic -1.2 +/- 0.9 mmHg, P greater than 0.05). These observations were confirmed after correction for physical activity, and cigarette and alcohol consumption (for age and body mass index).

abstract = {Recent studies have implicated leptin in the modulation of bone mass during skeletal development. Whether leptin also exerts an influence on bone after growth has stopped is unknown at present. In this cross-sectional study on 94 women (60 premenopausal, 34 postmenopausal) aged 40-60 years, we analyzed the relationship between serum leptin and bone density and bone cortex geometry and bone metabolism. Total and trabecular bone density as well as total and cortical bone area were determined by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) at the distal radius. Bone metabolism was assessed by measuring bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide (PICP) and collagen type I C-terminal telopeptide in serum, and deoxypyridinoline in urine samples. None of the indices of bone density or geometry was significantly related to leptin serum concentrations (P {\textgreater} 0.05) before or after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). PICP was associated with serum leptin in the postmenopausal group only (r = -0.40 after adjustment for BMI; P = 0.009). Yet, as none of the other markers of bone metabolism exhibited a significant correlation with serum leptin in any of the menopausal groups, this association is likely to be due to the influence of extraskeletal factors on PICP serum levels. Thus, it appears that leptin has less influence on the mature than on the growing skeleton.},

abstract = {The safety of green tea infusions and green tea extract (GTE)-based products is reviewed regarding catechins. Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the major catechin present in green tea, is suspected of being responsible for liver toxicity reported in humans consuming food supplements. Intake of EGCG with green tea infusions and GTE-based beverages is up to about 450 mg EGCG/person/day in Europe and higher in Asia. Consumption of green tea is not associated with liver damage in humans, and green tea infusion and GTE-based beverages are considered safe in the range of historical uses. In animal studies, EGCG's potency for liver effects is highly dependent on conditions of administration. Use of NOAELs from bolus administration to derive a tolerable upper intake level applying the margin of safety concept results in acceptable EGCG-doses lower than those from one cup of green tea. NOAELs from toxicity studies applying EGCG with diet/split of the daily dose are a better point of departure for risk characterization. In clinical intervention studies, liver effects were not observed after intakes below 600 mg EGCG/person/day. Thus, a tolerable upper intake level of 300 mg EGCG/person/day is proposed for food supplements; this gives a twofold safety margin to clinical studies that did not report liver effects and a margin of safety of 100 to the NOAELs in animal studies with dietary administration of green tea catechins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Evidence on the indirect health impacts of disasters is limited. We assessed the excess mortality risk associated with the indirect health impacts of the 2011 triple disaster (earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster) in Fukushima, Japan. METHODS The mortality rates in Soma and Minamisoma cities in Fukushima from 2006 to 2015 were calculated using vital statistics and resident registrations. We investigated the excess mortality risk, defined as the increased mortality risk between postdisaster and predisaster after excluding direct deaths attributed to the physical force of the disaster. Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of mortality after adjusting for city, age and year. RESULTS There were 6163 and 6125 predisaster and postdisaster deaths, respectively. The postdisaster mortality risk was significantly higher in the first month following the disaster (March 2011) than in the same month during the predisaster period (March 2006-2010). RRs among men and women were 2.64 (95{\%} CI 2.16 to 3.24) and 2.46 (95{\%} CI 1.99 to 3.03), respectively, demonstrating excess mortality risk due to the indirect health effects of the disaster. Age-specific subgroup analyses revealed a significantly higher mortality risk in women aged ≥85 years in the third month of the disaster compared with predisaster baseline, with an RR (95{\%} CI) of 1.73 (1.23 to 2.44). CONCLUSIONS Indirect health impacts are most severe in the first month of the disaster. Early public health support, especially for the elderly, can be an important factor for reducing the indirect health effects of a disaster.},

abstract = {Depth camera such as Microsoft Kinect, is much cheaper than conventional 3D scanning devices, and thus it can be acquired for everyday users easily. However, the depth data captured by Kinect over a certain distance is of extreme low quality. In this paper, we present a novel scanning system for capturing 3D full human body models by using multiple Kinects. To avoid the interference phenomena, we use two Kinects to capture the upper part and lower part of a human body respectively without overlapping region. A third Kinect is used to capture the middle part of the human body from the opposite direction. We propose a practical approach for registering the various body parts of different views under non-rigid deformation. First, a rough mesh template is constructed and used to deform successive frames pairwisely. Second, global alignment is performed to distribute errors in the deformation space, which can solve the loop closure problem efficiently. Misalignment caused by complex occlusion can also be handled reasonably by our global alignment algorithm. The experimental results have shown the efficiency and applicability of our system.

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive image reconstruction technique, whereby current is injected by electrodes and electric potential is measured by electrodes. In some electronic hardware implementations, only two electrodes inject current simultaneously, and are denominated pair-wise current injection. Several possibilities of pair-wise current injection (electric current patterns) and electric potential measurement (single-ended and differential) have been addressed in the literature. Considering pair-wise current injection, the skip-m current pattern can be defined as a pair-wise injection strategy in which the number of non-current injecting electrodes enclosed between two injection electrodes is m. Single-ended electric potential measurements consist of measurements with a common potential reference. Differential electric potential measurements consist of pair-wise measurements between two electrodes. A theoretical analysis based on control theory is presented to show that some current and measurement pattern strategies convey less information than others. This hypothesis is verified by the analysis of the matrix containing possible measurement vectors, with respect to its rank, condition number and singular values. Additionally, a novel approach is proposed to analyse current and measurement patterns based on uncertainty estimation of difference images by the correlation matrix linearization of the reconstructed impedance matrix. The results show that single-ended potential measurements are usually better when compared to differential electric potential measurements. A conclusion supported by both points of view is that the cross current pattern (diametral) is the least informative for these symmetrical domains.},

abstract = {Although electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for ventilation monitoring is on the verge of clinical trials, pulmonary perfusion imaging with EIT remains a challenge, especially in spontaneously breathing subjects. In anticipation of more research on this subject, we believe a thorough review is called for. In this paper, findings related to the physiological origins and electrical characteristics of this signal are summarized, highlighting properties that are particularly relevant to EIT. The perfusion impedance change signal is significantly smaller in amplitude compared with the changes due to ventilation. Therefore, the hardware used for this purpose must be more sensitive and more resilient to noise. In previous works, some signal- or image-processing methods have been required to separate these two signals. Three different techniques are reviewed in this paper, including the ECG-gating method, frequency-domain-filtering-based methods and a principal-component-analysis-based method. In addition, we review a number of experimental studies on both human and animal subjects that employed EIT for perfusion imaging, with promising results in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as other potential applications. In our opinion, PE is most likely to become the main focus for perfusion EIT in the future, especially for heavily instrumented patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).},

Eight healthy males (21-42 years old) with BMIs ranging from$\backslash$n18.6 to 25.3 kg/m2 were used for the methodological development.$\backslash$nAreas of tissues, organs and air/gas were measured in 28 cross-sectional$\backslash$nscans having defined and identical positions in all examined subjects.$\backslash$nThe area determinations were performed with the following attenuation$\backslash$nintervals (given in Hounsfield units, HU): air, gas and lungs: -1001$\backslash$nto -191 HU; adipose tissue (AT): -190 to -30 HU; all other soft tissues$\backslash$nand organs: -29 to +151 HU; skeleton: 152 to 2500 HU. Various tissue$\backslash$nand organ areas in the -29 to +151 HU interval were obtained by means$\backslash$nof cursor circumscriptions, while area determinations in other intervals$\backslash$nwere based on the number of pixels fulfilling given attenuation criteria.$\backslash$nVolumes of tissues, organs and gas were obtained from corresponding$\backslash$nareas and the distances between the scans. The body was divided into$\backslash$n12 main volumes of tissues, organs and gas that could be further$\backslash$nsubdivided by region.

abstract = {Objective: To develop an approach by which studies describing the accuracy of diagnostic tests or clinical predictions can be combined in a meta-analysis, even though studies may report their results using different summary measures. Study design: A method is proposed to allow algebraic and numerical conversion of values of the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (AUC) summary statistic into corresponding odds ratios (OR). A similar conversion is demonstrated for the standard errors (SEs) of these summary statistics. Results: The conversion of the AUC values into OR values was achieved using a logit-threshold model. The delta method was used to convert the associated SEs. An example concerning predictions of mortality in the intensive care unit illustrates the calculations. Conclusion: This paper provides an accessible method that permits the meta-analyst to overcome some of the difficulties implied by incomplete and inconsistent reporting of research studies in this area. It allows all studies to be included on the same metric, which in turn more easily permits exploration of issues such as heterogeneity. The method can readily be used for meta-analyses of diagnostic or screening tests, or for prediction data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Lung cancer and cardiovascular disease are major causes of death in the United States. It has been proposed that carotenoids and retinoids are agents that may prevent these disorders. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial -- the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial -- involving a total of 18,314 smokers, former smokers, and workers exposed to asbestos. The effects of a combination of 30 mg of beta carotene per day and 25,000 IU of retinol (vitamin A) in the form of retinyl palmitate per day on the primary end point, the incidence of lung cancer, were compared with those of placebo. RESULTS A total of 388 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed during the 73,135 person-years of follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 4.0 years). The active-treatment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.57; P=0.02), as compared with the placebo group. There were no statistically significant differences in the risks of other types of cancer. In the active-treatment group, the relative risk of death from any cause was 1.17 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.33); of death from lung cancer, 1.46 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 2.00); and of death from cardiovascular disease, 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.61). On the basis of these findings, the randomized trial was stopped 21 months earlier than planned; follow-up will continue for another 5 years. CONCLUSIONS After an average of four years of supplementation, the combination of beta carotene and vitamin A had no benefit and may have had an adverse effect on the incidence of lung cancer and on the risk of death from lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and any cause in smokers and workers exposed to asbestos.},

While the rising obesity epidemic drastically raised public awareness of the problem, the causes behind the epidemic are still poorly understood. The etiology of obesity is a subject of ongoing scientific debate with widely varying views and strong opinions. Is it mostly genetic or environmental in nature? Is obesity caused by changes in our diet or changes in lifestyle and physical activity or both? Modern research literature quite often offers conflicting findings. Publications in popular media like the one in Time magazine add to the controversy by making quick and strongly worded summaries of academic research. Although the root causes of obesity remains a topic of active research, this review concentrates on the fundamental components of weight regulation in humans and their relative contribution to the energy equation. A better understanding of the energetics of obesity may provide some insight into the etiology of the obesity epidemic. The energetics of obesity also showcases an engineering challenge: development of techniques to accurately measure individual components of the energy equation.},

abstract = {The tomographic imaging of tissue's electrical properties (e.g., conductivity and permittivity) has been greatly improved by recent developments in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, which include MR electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) and electrical property tomography. When the biological material is subjected to an external electric field, local changes in its electrical properties become sources of magnetic field perturbations, which are detectable by the MR signals. Controlling the external excitation and measuring the responses using an MRI scanner, we can formulate the imaging problem as an inverse problem in which unknown tissue properties are recovered from the acquired MR signals. This inverse problem is nonlinear; it involves the incorporation of Maxwell's equations and Bloch equations during data acquisition. Each method for visualizing internal conductivity and permittivity distributions has its own methodological limitations, and is restricted to imaging only a part of the ensemble or mean tissue structures or states. Therefore, imaging methods can be improved by developing complementary methods that can employ the beneficial aspects of various existing techniques. This paper focuses on recent progress in MREIT and discusses its distinct features in comparison with other imaging methods.},

abstract = {Activation of adenosine A2a receptors in cerebral neurons induces sleep in various mammals. It was previously found that Japanese sake yeast enriched in adenosine analogues activates A2a receptors in vitro and induces sleep in mice. Here it is reported that sake yeast activated A2a receptors in a cultured human cell line and improved human sleep quality in a clinical trial. Sake yeast activated A2a receptors in HEK cells in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 40 $\mu$g mL(-1), and the activation was attenuated almost completely by the A2a receptor antagonist ZM241385 with an IC50 of 73 nm. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical study, 68 healthy participants ingested tablets containing either 500 mg of sake yeast powder or a placebo (cellulose) 1 h before sleep for 4 days. Electroencephalograms were recorded during sleep at home with a portable device for 4 week days. Electroencephalogram analyses revealed that sake yeast supplementation significantly (P = 0.03) increased delta power during the first cycle of slow-wave sleep by 110{\%}, without changing other sleep parameters. Sake yeast supplementation also significantly increased growth hormone secretion in the urine on awakening by 137{\%} from 3.17 ± 0.41 (placebo) to 4.33 ± 0.62 (sake yeast) pg mg(-1) creatinine (P = 0.03). Subjective sleepiness (P = 0.02) and fatigue (P = 0.06) in the morning were improved by sake yeast. Given these benefits and the absence of adverse effects during the study period, it was concluded that sake yeast supplementation is an effective and safe way to support daily high-quality, deep sleep.},

abstract = {T he advent of computed tomography (ct) has revolutionized di- agnostic radiology. Since the inception of CT in the 1970s, its use has increased rapidly. It is estimated that more than 62 million CT scans per year are cur- rently obtained in the United States, including at least 4 million for children.1 By its nature, CT involves larger radiation doses than the more common, conven- tional x-ray imaging procedures (Table 1). We briefly review the nature of CT scanning and its main clinical applications, both in symptomatic patients and, in a more recent development, in the screening of asymptomatic patients. We focus on the increasing number of CT scans being obtained, the associated radiation doses, and the consequent cancer risks in adults and particularly in children. Al- though the risks for any one person are not large, the increasing exposure to ra- diation in the population may be a public health issue in the future.

abstract = {The use of transformations to stabilize the variance of binomial or Poisson data is familiar(Anscombe 1, Bartlett 2, 3, Curtiss 4, Eisenhart 5). The comparison of transformed binomial or Poisson data with percentage points of the normal distribution to make approximate significance tests or to set approximate confidence intervals is less familiar. Mosteller and Tukey 6 have recently made a graphical application of a transformation related to the square-root transformation for such purposes, where the use of "binomial probability paper" avoids all computation. We report here on an empirical study of a number of approximations, some intended for significance and confidence work and others for variance stabilization. For significance testing and the setting of confidence limits, we should like to use the normal deviate K exceeded with the same probability as the number of successes x from n in a binomial distribution with expectation np, which is defined by frac12pi int{\^{}}K-infty e{\^{}}-frac12t{\^{}}2 dt = operatornameProb x leq k mid operatornamebinomial, n, p. The most useful approximations to K that we can propose here are N (very simple), N{\^{}}+ (accurate near the usual percentage points), and N{\^{}}astast (quite accurate generally), where N = 2 (sqrt(k + 1)q - sqrt(n - k)p). (This is the approximation used with binomial probability paper.) N{\^{}}+ = N + fracN + 2p - 112sqrtE,quad E = textlesser of np textand nq, N{\^{}}ast = N + frac(N - 2)(N + 2)12 big(frac1sqrtnp + 1 - frac1sqrtnq + 1big), N{\^{}}astast = N{\^{}}ast + fracN{\^{}}ast + 2p - 112 sqrtEcdotquad E = textlesser of np textand nq. For variance stabilization, the averaged angular transformation sin{\^{}}-1sqrtfracxn + 1 + sin{\^{}}-1 sqrtfracx + 1n+1 has variance within pm 6{\%} of frac1n + frac12 text(angles in radians), frac821n + frac12 text(angles in degrees), for almost all cases where np geq 1. In the Poisson case, this simplifies to using sqrtx + sqrtx + 1 as having variance 1.},

abstract = {Background The distribution of frequency power (DFP) within the QRS complex (QRS) is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the DFP within the QRS in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) with lethal ventricular arrhythmias (L-VA). A computer simulation was performed to explore the mechanism of abnormal frequency power. Methods The study included 31 ICM patients with and without L-VA (n = 10 and 21, respectively). We applied the continuous wavelet transform to measure the time-frequency power within the QRS. Integrated time-frequency power (ITFP) was measured within the frequency range of 5–300 Hz. The simulation model consisted of two-dimensional myocardial tissues intermingled with fibroblasts. We examined the relation between frequency power calculated from the simulated QRS and the fibroblast-to-myocyte ratio (r) of the model. Results The frequency powers significantly increased from 180 to 300 Hz and from 5 to 15 Hz, and also decreased from 45 to 80 Hz in patients with ICM and L-VA compared with the normal individuals. They increased from 110 Hz to 250 Hz in ICM alone. In the simulation, the high-frequency power increased when the ratio (r) were 2.0–2.5. Functional reentry was initiated if the ratio (r) increased to 2.0. Conclusions Abnormal higher-frequency power (180–300 Hz) may provide arrhythmogenic signals in ICM with L-VA that may be associated with the fibrous tissue proliferation.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids (GCs) are well known to induce insulin resistance. However, the effect of GCs on insulin secretion has not been well characterized under physiological conditions in human. We here evaluated the effect of GCs on insulin secretion/{\ss}-cell function precisely in a physiological condition. A population-based study of 1,071 Japanese individuals enrolled in the 2014 Iwaki study (390 men, 681 women; aged 54.1 ± 15.1 years), those excluded individuals taking medication for diabetes or steroid treatment, were enrolled in the present study. Association between serum cortisol levels and insulin resistance/secretion assessed by homeostasis model assessment using fasting blood glucose and insulin levels (HOMA-R and HOMA-{\ss}, respectively) were examined. Univariate linear regression analyses showed correlation of serum cortisol levels with HOMA-{\ss} ({\ss} = -0.134, p {\textless}0.001) but not with HOMA-R ({\ss} = 0.042, p = 0.172). Adjustments for age, gender, and the multiple clinical characteristics correlated with HOMA indices showed similar results (HOMA-{\ss}: {\ss} = -0.062, p = 0.025; HOMA-R: {\ss} = -0.023, p = 0.394). The correlation between serum cortisol levels and HOMA-{\ss} remained significant after adjustment for HOMA- R ({\ss} = -0.057, p = 0.034). When subjects were tertiled based on serum cortisol levels, the highest tertile was at greater risk of decreased insulin secretion (defined as lower one third of HOMA-{\ss} (≤70)) than the lowest tertile, after adjustment for multiple factors including HOMA- R (odds ratio 1.26, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.03-1.54). In conclusion, higher serum cortisol levels are significantly associated with decreased insulin secretion in the physiological cortisol range in a Japanese population.},

There is increasing evidence that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) play a pivotal role in atherosclerosis, in particular in diabetes.

Furthermore, increased AGE accumulation is closely related to the development of cardiovascular complications in diabetes.

@article{DeMunck2000,
abstract = {In this paper, a new formulation of the reconstruction problem of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is proposed. Instead of reconstructing a complete two-dimensional picture, a parameter representation of the gross anatomy is formulated, of which the optimal parameters are determined by minimizing a cost function. The two great advantages of this method are that the number of unknown parameters of the inverse problem is drastically reduced and that quantitative information of interest (e.g., lung volume) is estimated directly from the data, without image segmentation steps. The forward problem of EIT is to compute the potentials at the voltage measuring electrodes, for a given set of current injection electrodes and a given conductivity geometry. In this paper, it is proposed to use an improved boundary element method (BEM) technique to solve the forward problem, in which flat boundary elements are replaced by polygonal ones. From a comparison with the analytical solution of the concentric circle model, it appears that the use of polygonal elements greatly improves the accuracy of the BEM, without increasing the computation time. In this formulation, the inverse problem is a nonlinear parameter estimation problem with a limited number of parameters. Variants of Powell's and the simplex method are used to minimize the cost function. The applicability of this solution of the EIT problem was tested in a series of simulation studies. In these studies, EIT data were simulated using a standard conductor geometry and it was attempted to find back this geometry from random starting values. In the inverse algorithm, different current injection and voltage measurement schemes and different cost functions were compared. In a simulation study, it was demonstrated that a systematic error in the assumed lung conductivity results in a proportional error in the lung cross sectional area. It appears that our parametric formulation of the inverse problem leads to a stable minimization problem, with a high reliability, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is about ten or higher.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) conference was convened to address standards for improving the quality of reporting of meta-analyses of clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: The QUOROM group consisted of 30 clinical epidemiologists, clinicians, statisticians, editors, and researchers. In conference, the group was asked to identify items they thought should be included in a checklist of standards. Whenever possible, checklist items were guided by research evidence suggesting that failure to adhere to the item proposed could lead to biased results. A modified Delphi technique was used in assessing candidate items. FINDINGS: The conference resulted in the QUOROM statement, a checklist, and a flow diagram. The checklist describes our preferred way to present the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of a report of a meta-analysis. It is organised into 21 headings and subheadings regarding searches, selection, validity assessment, data abstraction, study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis, and in the results with "trial flow", study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis; research documentation was identified for eight of the 18 items. The flow diagram provides information about both the numbers of RCTs identified, included, and excluded and the reasons for exclusion of trials. INTERPRETATION: We hope this report will generate further thought about ways to improve the quality of reports of meta-analyses of RCTs and that interested readers, reviewers, researchers, and editors will use the QUOROM statement and generate ideas for its improvement.},

abstract = {Although several nutrients and foods are suggested to be preventive against postpartum depression, all previous studies have primarily focused on single nutrients or foods. In contrast, studies on dietary patterns, namely the measurement of overall diet by considering the cumulative effects of nutrient, may provide new insights into the influence of diet on postpartum depression. We prospectively exam- ined the association between dietary patterns during pregnancy and the risk of postpartum depression among 865 Japanese women. Diet was assessed with a validated, self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns from thirty-three predefined food groups (energy-adjusted food (g/d)) were extracted by factor analysis. Postpartum depression was defined as present when the subjects had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of {\$}9 at 2–9 months postpartum. A total of 121 women (14{\textperiodcentered}0 {\%}) were classified as having postpartum depression. Three dietary patterns were identified: ‘Healthy', ‘Western' and ‘Japanese' patterns. After adjustment for potential confounders, neither the ‘Healthy' nor the ‘Japanese' pattern was related to the risk of postpartum depression. Compared with the first quartile of the ‘Western' pattern, only the second quartile was independently related to a decreased risk of postpartum depression (multivariate OR 0{\textperiodcentered}52, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}30, 0{\textperiodcentered}93), although no evident exposure–response associations were observed (P for trend¼0{\textperiodcentered}36). The present study failed to substantiate clear associations between dietary patterns and the risk of postpartum depression. Further studies with more accurate measurements are warranted to confirm the relationship between dietary patterns and the risk of postpartum depression.},

abstract = {To investigate connectivity between primary somatosensory area (S1) and striate cortex (V1) in the blind, we used dynamic causal modeling of functional MRI acquired while 15 blind (9 early-onset and 6 late-onset) and 24 sighted subjects performed a tactile Braille discrimination task with their right hand. Five regions of interest were selected from either the ventral or dorsal pathways: left S1, anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), superior occipital gyrus (SOG), inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), and V1. Bayesian model comparison showed that a cortico-cortical feedback pathway model without direct connections between V1 and S1 performed better than that with direct connections. In the blind, baseline connectivity and its discrimination-specific modulation in aIPS-SOG and aIPS-IOG were positive and bi-directional, while they were negative in the sighted. Thus visual deprivation may induce reorganization of the visual cortical areas due to the competitive shift for tactile inputs. The early blind showed stronger connectivity than the late blind in the dorsal pathway (aIPS-V1 through SOG) and in SOG-IOG bi-directionally. Task performance positively correlated with baseline connectivity of SOG-V1 and SOG-IOG across blind subjects. Therefore, dorsal visual regions are involved in the functional shift in V1 from visual to tactile information processing in blind subjects. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

@article{Kaipio2000,
abstract = {This paper discusses the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problem: electric currents are injected into a body with unknown electromagnetic properties through a set of contact electrodes. The corresponding voltages that are needed to maintain these currents are measured. The objective is to estimate the unknown resistivity, or more generally the impedivity distribution of the body based on this information. The most commonly used method to tackle this problem in practice is to use gradient-based local linearizations. We give a proof for the differentiability of the electrode boundary data with respect to the resistivity distribution and the contact impedances. Due to the ill-posedness of the problem, regularization has to be employed. In this paper, we consider the EIT problem in the framework of Bayesian statistics, where the inverse problem is recast into a form of statistical inference. The problem is to estimate the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters conditioned on measurement data. From the posterior density, various estimates for the resistivity distribution can be calculated as well as a posteriori uncertainties. The search of the maximum a posteriori estimate is typically an optimization problem, while the conditional expectation is computed by integrating the variable with respect to the posterior probability distribution. In practice, especially when the dimension of the parameter space is large, this integration must be done by Monte Carlo methods such as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. These methods can also be used for calculation of a posteriori uncertainties for the estimators. In this paper, we concentrate on MCMC integration methods. In particular, we demonstrate by numerical examples the statistical approach when the prior densities are non-differentiable, such as the prior penalizing the total variation or the L 1 norm of the resistivity.},

abstract = {Traditionally, image reconstruction in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been based on Laplace's equation. However, at high frequencies the coupling between electric and magnetic fields requires solution of the full Maxwell equations. In this paper, a formulation is presented in terms of the Maxwell equations expressed in scalar and vector potentials. The approach leads to boundary conditions that naturally align with the quantities measured by EIT instrumentation. A two-dimensional implementation for image reconstruction from EIT data is realized. The effect of frequency on the field distribution is illustrated using the high-frequency model and is compared with Laplace solutions. Numerical simulations and experimental results are also presented to illustrate image reconstruction over a range of frequencies using the new implementation. The results show that scalar/vector potential reconstruction produces images which are essentially indistinguishable from a Laplace algorithm for frequencies below 1 MHz but superior at frequencies reaching 10 MHz.},

abstract = {Molecular epidemiological studies can provide novel insights into the transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Typically, risk factors for transmission are identified using traditional hypothesis-driven statistical methods such as logistic regression. However, limitations become apparent in these approaches as the scope of these studies expand to include additional epidemiological and bacterial genomic data. Here we examine the use of Bayesian models to analyze tuberculosis epidemiology. We begin by exploring the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) to identify the distribution of tuberculosis patient attributes (including demographic and clinical attributes). Using existing algorithms for constructing BNs from observational data, we learned a BN from data about tuberculosis patients collected in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999. We verified that the resulting probabilistic models did in fact capture known statistical relationships. Next, we examine the use of newly introduced methods for representing and automatically constructing probabilistic models in structured domains. We use statistical relational models (SRMs) to model distributions over relational domains. SRMs are ideally suited to richly structured epidemiological data. We use a data-driven method to construct a statistical relational model directly from data stored in a relational database. The resulting model reveals the relationships between variables in the data and describes their distribution. We applied this procedure to the data on tuberculosis patients in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999, their Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and data on contact investigations. The resulting statistical relational model corroborated previously reported findings and revealed several novel associations. These models illustrate the potential for this approach to reveal relationships within richly structured data that may not be apparent using conventional statistical approaches. We show that Bayesian methods, in particular statistical relational models, are an important tool for understanding infectious disease epidemiology. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Tabesh2010,
abstract = {Background: In many areas of medical research, a bivariate analysis is desirable because it simultaneously tests two response variables that are of equal interest and importance in two populations. Several parametric and nonparametric bivariate procedures are available for the location problem but each of them requires a series of stringent assumptions such as specific distribution, affine-invariance or elliptical symmetry. The aim of this study is to propose a powerful test statistic that requires none of the aforementioned assumptions. We have reduced the bivariate problem to the univariate problem of sum or subtraction of measurements. A simple bivariate test for the difference in location between two populations is proposed. Method: In this study the proposed test is compared with Hotelling's T 2 test, two sample Rank test, Cramer test for multivariate two sample problem and Mathur's test using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The power study shows that the proposed test performs better than any of its competitors for most of the populations considered and is equivalent to the Rank test in specific distributions. Conclusions: Using simulation studies, we show that the proposed test will perform much better under different conditions of underlying population distribution such as normality or non-normality, skewed or symmetric, medium tailed or heavy tailed. The test is therefore recommended for practical applications because it is more powerful than any of the alternatives compared in this paper for almost all the shifts in location and in any direction.},

Acetone emitted from human skin (skin acetone) should be a good indicator of fat metabolism, which is associated with diet and exercise. However, skin acetone is an analytically challenging target because it is emitted in very low concentrations. In the present study, zeolite was investigated for concentrating skin acetone for subsequent semiconductor-based analysis. The adsorption and desorption characteristics of five zeolites with different structures and those hydrophobicities were compared. A hydrophobic zeolite with relatively large pores (approximately 1.6 times larger than the acetone molecule diameter) was the best concentrator of skin acetone among the zeolites tested. The concentrator developed using zeolite was applied in a semiconductor-based gas sensor in a simulated mobile environment where the closed space was frequently collapsed to reflect the twisting and elastic movement of skin that would be encountered in a wearable device. These results could be used to develop a wearable analyzer for skin acetone, which would be a powerful tool for preventing and alleviating lifestyle-related diseases.},

Storey introduced a point estimate of the FDR for fixed significance regions.The former approach conservatively controls the FDR at a fixed predetermined level, and the latter provides a conservatively biased estimate of the FDR for a fixed predetermined significance region. In this work, we show in both finite sample and asymptotic settings that the goals of the two approaches are essentially equivalent. In particular, the FDR point estimates can be used to define valid FDR controlling procedures. In the asymptotic setting,we also showthat the point estimates can be used to estimate the FDR conservatively over all significance regions simul- taneously, which is equivalent to controlling the FDR at all levels simultaneously.The main tool that we use is to translate existing FDR methods into procedures involving empirical processes. This simplifies finite sample proofs, provides a framework for asymptotic results and proves that these procedures are valid even under certain forms of dependence.},

abstract = {In a previous publication, it was demonstrated that the abdominal subcutaneous fat layer thickness (SFL) is strongly correlated with the abdominal electrical impedance when measured with a transversal tetrapolar electrode arrangement. This article addresses the following questions: 1) To which extent do different abdominal compartments contribute to the impedance? 2) How does the hydration state of tissues affect the data? 3) Can hydration and fat content be assessed independently? For simulating the measured data a hierarchical electrical model was built. The abdomen was subdivided into three compartments (subcutaneous fat, muscle, mesentery). The true anatomical structure of the compartment boundaries was modeled using finite-element modeling (FEM). Each compartment is described by an electrical tissue model parameterized in physiological terms. Assuming the same percent change of the fat fraction in the mesentery and the SFL the model predicts a change of 1,24 omega/mm change of the SFL compared to 1,1 omega/mm measured. 42{\%} of the change stem from the SFL, 56{\%} from the mesentery and 2{\%} from changes of fat within the muscle compartment. A 1{\%} increase of the extracellular water in the muscle is not discernible from a 1{\%} decrease of the SFL. The measured data reflect not only the SFL but also the visceral fat. The tetrapolar electrode arrangement allows the measurement of the abdominal fat content only if the hydration remains constant.},

abstract = {A clustering of metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, all of which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), occurs more often than by chance. Numerous epidemiological studies, as well as basic researches, have revealed that visceral fat accumulation is closely involved in this risk clustering. This morbid condition is now well recognized as the metabolic syndrome. The concept of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., the involvement of visceral adiposity in the clustering of CVD risk factors, implies that an effective CVD risk reduction will be accomplished by an intervention to reduce visceral fat deposits. The primary strategy of the intervention is lifestyle modification, which can be put into practice in healthcare fields, without necessity of medical treatment. Now that CVD is a leading global health burden, the metabolic syndrome attracts increasing attention in the world. To take global action against the syndrome, several working groups developed its internationally unified diagnostic criteria. Most recently, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) jointly proposed the criteria, although some cautions will be needed in their practical use. In this review, we mainly focus on the findings observed in clinical and epidemiological studies, to discuss a practical strategy of the management of the metabolic syndrome in healthcare fields.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A comprehensive self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ: 150-item semi-quantitative questionnaire) and a brief self-administered DHQ (BDHQ: 58-item fixed-portion-type questionnaire) were developed for assessing Japanese diets. We compared the relative validity of nutrient intake derived from DHQ with that from the BDHQ, using semi-weighed 16-day dietary records (DRs) as reference.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Ninety-two Japanese women aged 31 to 69 years and 92 Japanese men aged 32 to 76 years completed a 4-nonconsecutive-day DR, a DHQ, and a BDHQ 4 times each (once per season) in 3 areas of Japan (Osaka, Nagano, and Tottori).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No significant differences were seen in estimates of energy-adjusted intakes of 42 selected nutrients (based on the residual method) between the 16-day DRs and the first DHQ (DHQ1) or between the DR and the first BDHQ (BDHQ1) for 18 (43{\%}) and 14 (33{\%}) nutrients, respectively, among women and for 4 (10{\%}) and 21 (50{\%}) nutrients among men. The median (interquartile range) Pearson correlation coefficients with the DR for energy-adjusted intakes of the 42 nutrients were 0.57 (0.50 to 0.64) for the DHQ1 and 0.54 (0.45 to 0.61) for the BDHQ1 in women; in men, the respective values were 0.50 (0.42 to 0.59) and 0.56 (0.41 to 0.63). Similar results were observed for the means of the 4 DHQs and BDHQs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The DHQ and BDHQ had satisfactory ranking ability for the energy-adjusted intakes of many nutrients among the present Japanese population, although these instruments were satisfactory in estimating mean values for only a small number of nutrients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare micronutrient intake status of those overweight and those obese with normal weight adults. METHODS Using total nutrient intake (from foods and supplements) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2008, we determined usual intakes for micronutrients using the National Cancer Institute methodology in adults (n = 18,177). Only subjects with reliable dietary records were included and pregnant and lactating females were excluded. Subjects were categorized by body weight status as either normal weight (body mass index [BMI] {\textless} 25), overweight (BMI ≥ 25 to {\textless} 30), or obese (BMI ≥ 30). RESULTS A substantial proportion of the adult population (over 40{\%}) had inadequate intakes of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, calcium, and magnesium. Compared to normal weight adults, obese adults had about 5{\%} to 12{\%} lower (p {\textless} 0.05) intakes of micronutrients and higher (p {\textless} 0.01) prevalence of nutrient inadequacy. CONCLUSION We conclude that obese adults compared to normal weight adults have lower micronutrient intake and higher prevalence of micronutrient inadequacy.},

abstract = {AIM The clustering of metabolic abnormalities occurs not only due to abdominal obesity but also other etiologies. We investigated the contribution of visceral fat accumulation and the circulating adiponectin level to the clustering of metabolic abnormalities in a Japanese population. METHODS We used the data for 1,989 Japanese employees to perform a structural equation modeling analysis. According to the concept of metabolic syndrome, we developed a multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) model and investigated to what extent measurements of the visceral fat area (VFA) and circulating adiponectin levels explain the morbidity of clustering of metabolic abnormalities, represented as a latent variable termed "risk clustering." The following clinically measurable parameters were set as the phenotypes of the risk clustering: systolic blood pressure and glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid and alanine aminotransferase levels. RESULTS The mean age of the subjects was 46±11 years, and 72{\%} of the participants were men. A VFA of ≥100 cm(2) was observed in 32{\%} of the subjects. The squared multiple correlation R(2) of the risk clustering was as high as 0.73, indicating that the measurements of the VFA and adiponectin levels explained 73{\%} of the variance in the risk clustering. The R(2) between the risk clustering and metabolic parameters ranged from 0.14 to 0.54, thus indicating that these metabolic parameters reflected the development of morbidity of the risk clustering in the body within a range of 14{\%} to 54{\%}. CONCLUSIONS The measurements of the VFA and adiponectin level makes a considerable contribution to the risk clustering.},

We compared the activation in the brain obtained during reported high states of motivation for learning, with the ones observed when the motivation was based on monetary reward. Our results show that motivation to learn correlates with bilateral activity in the putamen, and that the higher the reported motivation, as derived from a questionnaire that each subject filled prior to scanning, the greater the change in the BOLD signals within the putamen. Monetary motivation also activated the putamen bilaterally, though the intensity of activity was not related to the monetary reward. We conclude that the putamen is critical for motivation in different domains and the extent of activity of the putamen may be pivotal to the motivation that drives academic achievement and thus academic successes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

While the United States gained an early lead in unnecessary weight gain, most other countries are quickly closing the gap. The latest U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm) documents that about one third of adults in the United States are now overweight [a body-mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30 kg/m2] and another one third (61 million) are considered obese (BMI {\textgreater}30 kg/m2). Being obese is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, some cancers, and depression. The economic impact of this condition is staggering: in 2008, more than 147 billion dollars were spent just in the United States for medical costs related to obesity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The possible advantage for weight loss of a diet that emphasizes protein, fat, or carbohydrates has not been established, and there are few studies that extend beyond 1 year. METHODS We randomly assigned 811 overweight adults to one of four diets; the targeted percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65{\%}; 20, 25, and 55{\%}; 40, 15, and 45{\%}; and 40, 25, and 35{\%}. The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health. The participants were offered group and individual instructional sessions for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 years in two-by-two factorial comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content. RESULTS At 6 months, participants assigned to each diet had lost an average of 6 kg, which represented 7{\%} of their initial weight; they began to regain weight after 12 months. By 2 years, weight loss remained similar in those who were assigned to a diet with 15{\%} protein and those assigned to a diet with 25{\%} protein (3.0 and 3.6 kg, respectively); in those assigned to a diet with 20{\%} fat and those assigned to a diet with 40{\%} fat (3.3 kg for both groups); and in those assigned to a diet with 65{\%} carbohydrates and those assigned to a diet with 35{\%} carbohydrates (2.9 and 3.4 kg, respectively) (P{\textgreater}0.20 for all comparisons). Among the 80{\%} of participants who completed the trial, the average weight loss was 4 kg; 14 to 15{\%} of the participants had a reduction of at least 10{\%} of their initial body weight. Satiety, hunger, satisfaction with the diet, and attendance at group sessions were similar for all diets; attendance was strongly associated with weight loss (0.2 kg per session attended). The diets improved lipid-related risk factors and fasting insulin levels. CONCLUSIONS Reduced-calorie diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00072995.)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Excess adiposity is associated with greater systemic inflammation. Whether visceral adiposity is more proinflammatory than subcutaneous abdominal adiposity is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS We examined the relations of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), assessed by multidetector computerized tomography, to circulating inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in 1250 Framingham Heart Study participants (52{\%} women; age 60+/-9 years). Biomarkers were examined in relation to increments of SAT and VAT after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, menopause, hormone replacement therapy, alcohol, and aspirin use; additional models included body mass index and waist circumference. SAT and VAT were positively and similarly (with respect to strength of association) related to C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-6, P-selectin, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 (multivariable model R2 0.06 to 0.28 [SAT] and 0.07 to 0.29 [VAT]). However, compared with SAT, VAT was more highly associated with urinary isoprostanes and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (SAT versus VAT comparison: isoprostanes, R2 0.07 versus 0.10, P=0.002; monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, R2 0.07 versus 0.08, P=0.04). When body mass index and waist circumference were added to the models, VAT remained significantly associated with only C-reactive protein (P=0.0003 for women; P=0.006 for men), interleukin-6 (P=0.01), isoprostanes (P=0.0002), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P=0.008); SAT only remained associated with fibrinogen (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS The present cross-sectional data support an association between both SAT and VAT with inflammation and oxidative stress. The data suggest that the contribution of visceral fat to inflammation may not be completely accounted for by clinical measures of obesity (body mass index and waist circumference).},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that enhancing memory of the last meal decreases later snack intake, whereas disruption of encoding in memory of the last meal increases subsequent snack intake. Other studies have found that manipulating cognitions at the time of eating, such as beliefs about the timing and composition of meals, can affect subsequent intake. The effects of many of these cognitions are likely to depend on prior association in memory between situational and sensory cues and particular postingestional or affective consequences of eating. Hence, memory for the specific attributes of foods eaten in the recent past, and memory for the predicted consequences of eating acquired over repeated experiences are important influences on food intake. These data are consistent with evidence of hyperphagia in amnesic patients and laboratory animals with lesions to the hippocampus, an important substrate for learning and memory. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Given that environmental factors such as dietary habits may play a major role in the causation of prostate cancer and the high consumption of green tea in Asian populations, this low incidence may be partly due to the effects of green tea. The JPHC Study (Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study) was established in 1990 for cohort I and in 1993 for cohort II. The subjects were 49,920 men aged 40-69 years who completed a questionnaire that included their green tea consumption habit at baseline and were followed until the end of 2004. During this time, 404 men were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, of whom 114 had advanced cases, 271 were localized, and 19 were of an undetermined stage. Green tea was not associated with localized prostate cancer. However, consumption was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in the risk of advanced prostate cancer. The multivariate relative risk was 0.52 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.28, 0.96) for men drinking 5 or more cups/day compared with less than 1 cup/day (p(trend) = 0.01).

Due to high cost and laboriousness in experimental tests, it is necessary to develop robust in silico methods to predict chemical mutagenicity. In this paper, a comprehensive database containing 7617 diverse compounds, including 4252 mutagens and 3365 nonmutagens, was constructed. On the basis of this data set, high predictive models were then built using five machine learning methods, namely support vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree (C4.5 DT), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB), along with five fingerprints, namely CDK fingerprint (FP), Estate fingerprint (Estate), MACCS keys (MACCS), PubChem fingerprint (PubChem), and Substructure fingerprint (SubFP). Performances were measured by cross validation and an external test set containing 831 diverse chemicals. Information gain and substructure analysis were used to interpret the models. The accuracies of fivefold cross validation were from 0.808 to 0.841 for top five models. The range of accuracy for the external validation set was from 0.904 to 0.980, which outperformed that of Toxtree. Three models (PubChem-kNN, MACCS-kNN, and PubChem-SVM) showed high and reliable predictive accuracy for the mutagens and nonmutagens and, hence, could be used in prediction of chemical Ames mutagenicity.},

Although there are a number of candidate antiobesity drugs, only a few of them have been proven able to inhibit appetite for palatable foods without the concurrent reduction in regular food consumption. In this review, we discuss the interrelationships between homeostatic and hedonic food intake control mechanisms in promoting overeating with palatable foods and assess the potential usefulness of systemically administered pharmaceuticals that impinge on the endogenous cannabinoid, opioid, aminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic systems in the modification of food preference behavior. Also, certain dietary supplements with the potency to reduce specifically palatable food intake are presented. Based on human and animal studies, we indicate the most promising therapies and agents that influence the effectiveness of appetite-modifying drugs. It should be stressed, however, that most of the data included in our review come from preclinical studies; therefore, further investigations aimed at confirming the effectiveness and safety of the aforementioned medications in the treatment of obese humans are necessary.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diacylglycerol (DAG)-rich oil has been suggested to suppress postprandial hyperlipidemia and promote negative caloric balance by increasing energy expenditure (EE), due to small intestine physiochemical dynamics that differ from triacylglycerol (TAG). We studied the effect of DAG on postprandial glucose/insulin metabolism by loading of carbohydrate with oil. Further, to reveal the mechanism for increased EE by DAG, we measured plasma serotonin, which is mostly present in the small intestine and mediates peripheral sympathetic thermogenesis. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Randomized crossover study with 2-week wash-out interval between differing fat ingestion. Seven male, lean, Japanese students ingested DAG or TAG oil with 40 g of carbohydrate. Measurements of metabolic parameters were performed before and at 2, 4, and 6 h after fat ingestion. Plasma serotonin levels and cholesterol concentration in each lipoprotein were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The substitution of DAG for TAG decreased very-low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) by 45.6{\%} at 2 h, and decreased serum insulin by 41.3{\%} at 4 h after ingestion. The incremental area under the curve (IAUC) for VLDL-C was positively correlated with the IAUC for insulin. Concurrently, DAG elevated plasma serotonin levels by 47.3{\%} at 2 h, while TAG did not influence. DISCUSSION: This study indicates that the substitution of DAG for TAG suppresses the postprandial increase in serum VLDL-C and insulin. This study also demonstrates that DAG ingestion increases plasma serotonin, proposing a possible mechanism for a postprandial increase in EE by DAG.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the pattern of the metabolic syndrome in Chinese$\backslash$nand the causal relationships among its components, including aging,$\backslash$nobesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia$\backslash$nin these subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on a 75-g oral$\backslash$nglucose tolerance test, the World Health Organization criteria were$\backslash$nused for the diagnosis of glucose intolerance in a population-based$\backslash$nstudy involving 1.513 Chinese subjects in two work sites. Demographic$\backslash$ndata including age, family history of diabetes, BMI, waist-to-hip$\backslash$nratio (WHR), and sitting blood pressure (BP) were documented. Fasting$\backslash$nplasma glucose, triglyceride (TG) and insulin concentrations, and$\backslash$nspot urinary albumin concentration (Ualb) were also measured. Structural$\backslash$nequation modeling incorporating factor analysis and path analysis$\backslash$nwas performed to examine the causal relationships among these variables$\backslash$nand their interactions. RESULTS: Subjects who were treated with antidiabetic$\backslash$nand/or antihypertensive drugs or who had a plasma creatinine level$\backslash$n{\textgreater} or = 150 mumol/l were excluded (n = 52). The prevalence of diabetes$\backslash$nand impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were 3.9{\%} (n = 34) and 7.2{\%}$\backslash$n(n = 63) in men (n = 881) and 3.1{\%} (n = 18) and 6.7{\%} (n = 39) in$\backslash$nwomen (n = 580), respectively. In both groups, glucose intolerance$\backslash$nwas associated with increasing age, higher BMI, WHR, BP, Ualb, serum$\backslash$nTG, and insulin levels as well as higher prevalence rates of positive$\backslash$nfamily history of diabetes. Structural equation modeling showed that$\backslash$nage was a significant determinant for both BMI and WHR. Age and obesity$\backslash$naccounted for most of the variance of BP, Ualb, plasma glucose, insulin$\backslash$nand TG levels either directly or indirectly. Plasma glucose was determined$\backslash$nby a positive family history of diabetes, age, and BMI while TG was$\backslash$ndependent on BMI and WHR. Serum insulin was mainly determined by$\backslash$na positive family history of diabetes, obesity, plasma glucose, and$\backslash$nTG levels. Apart from age and obesity, BP was also determined by$\backslash$nserum insulin, both of which had causal effects on Ualb. CONCLUSIONS:$\backslash$nThis model emphasizes the centrality of aging and obesity as well$\backslash$nas a positive family history of diabetes as major determinants of$\backslash$nthe components of the metabolic syndrome. These components in turn$\backslash$nhad causal effects upon one another. Apart from a familial tendency,$\backslash$na central neurohormonal mechanism may account for these abnormalities$\backslash$nmediated primarily through obesity and in close association with$\backslash$naging.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review associations between intake of saturated fat and trans unsaturated fat and all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD) and associated mortality, ischemic stroke, and type 2 diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, and CINAHL from inception to 1 May 2015, supplemented by bibliographies of retrieved articles and previous reviews.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Observational studies reporting associations of saturated fat and/or trans unsaturated fat (total, industrially manufactured, or from ruminant animals) with all cause mortality, CHD/CVD mortality, total CHD, ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study risks of bias. Multivariable relative risks were pooled. Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified. Potential publication bias was assessed and subgroup analyses were undertaken. The GRADE approach was used to evaluate quality of evidence and certainty of conclusions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For saturated fat, three to 12 prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (five to 17 comparisons with 90 501-339 090 participants). Saturated fat intake was not associated with all cause mortality (relative risk 0.99, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.91 to 1.09), CVD mortality (0.97, 0.84 to 1.12), total CHD (1.06, 0.95 to 1.17), ischemic stroke (1.02, 0.90 to 1.15), or type 2 diabetes (0.95, 0.88 to 1.03). There was no convincing lack of association between saturated fat and CHD mortality (1.15, 0.97 to 1.36; P=0.10). For trans fats, one to six prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (two to seven comparisons with 12 942-230 135 participants). Total trans fat intake was associated with all cause mortality (1.34, 1.16 to 1.56), CHD mortality (1.28, 1.09 to 1.50), and total CHD (1.21, 1.10 to 1.33) but not ischemic stroke (1.07, 0.88 to 1.28) or type 2 diabetes (1.10, 0.95 to 1.27). Industrial, but not ruminant, trans fats were associated with CHD mortality (1.18 (1.04 to 1.33) v 1.01 (0.71 to 1.43)) and CHD (1.42 (1.05 to 1.92) v 0.93 (0.73 to 1.18)). Ruminant trans-palmitoleic acid was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (0.58, 0.46 to 0.74). The certainty of associations between saturated fat and all outcomes was "very low." The certainty of associations of trans fat with CHD outcomes was "moderate" and "very low" to "low" for other associations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Saturated fats are not associated with all cause mortality, CVD, CHD, ischemic stroke, or type 2 diabetes, but the evidence is heterogeneous with methodological limitations. Trans fats are associated with all cause mortality, total CHD, and CHD mortality, probably because of higher levels of intake of industrial trans fats than ruminant trans fats. Dietary guidelines must carefully consider the health effects of recommendations for alternative macronutrients to replace trans fats and saturated fats.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is used to image the electrical property distribution of a tissue under test. An EIT system comprises complex hardware and software modules, which are typically designed for a specific application. Upgrading these modules is a time-consuming process, and requires rigorous testing to ensure proper functioning of new modules with the existing ones. To this end, we developed a modular and reconfigurable data acquisition (DAQ) system using National Instruments' (NI) hardware and software modules, which offer inherent compatibility over generations of hardware and software revisions. The system can be configured to use up to 32-channels. This EIT system can be used to interchangeably apply current or voltage signal, and measure the tissue response in a semi-parallel fashion. A novel signal averaging algorithm, and 512-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) computation block was implemented on the FPGA. FFT output bins were classified as signal or noise. Signal bins constitute a tissue's response to a pure or mixed tone signal. Signal bins' data can be used for traditional applications, as well as synchronous frequency-difference imaging. Noise bins were used to compute noise power on the FPGA. Noise power represents a metric of signal quality, and can be used to ensure proper tissue-electrode contact. Allocation of these computationally expensive tasks to the FPGA reduced the required bandwidth between PC, and the FPGA for high frame rate EIT. In 16-channel configuration, with a signal-averaging factor of 8, the DAQ frame rate at 100 kHz exceeded 110 frames s (-1), and signal-to-noise ratio exceeded 90 dB across the spectrum. Reciprocity error was found to be for frequencies up to 1 MHz. Static imaging experiments were performed on a high-conductivity inclusion placed in a saline filled tank; the inclusion was clearly localized in the reconstructions obtained for both absolute current and voltage mode data.},

This article updates the 1993 report, using new and further evidence from the scientific literature. Current recommendations for primary prevention of hypertension involve a population-based approach and an intensive targeted strategy focused on individuals at high risk for hypertension. These 2 strategies are complementary and emphasize 6 approaches with proven efficacy for prevention of hypertension: engage in moderate physical activity; maintain normal body weight; limit alcohol consumption; reduce sodium intake; maintain adequate intake of potassium; and consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and reduced in saturated and total fat. Applying these approaches to the general population as a component of public health and clinical practice can help prevent blood pressure from increasing and can help decrease elevated blood pressure levels for those with high normal blood pressure or hypertension.},

Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

Because of a lack of prospective data, retrospective collection of data on adolescent diet is essential. The authors evaluated a 124-item high school food frequency questionnaire (HS-FFQ) assessing diet during high school (15-35 years in the past) that was completed in 1998 by 45,947 US women in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII) cohort. To assess reproducibility, the authors readministered the HS-FFQ approximately 4 years later to 333 of these women. The mean Pearson correlation for 38 nutrient intakes was 0.65 (range, 0.50-0.77), and the mean Spearman rank correlation for food intakes was 0.60 (range, 0.37-0.77). Current adult diet was only weakly correlated with recalled adolescent diet (for nutrient intakes, mean r = 0.20). For assessment of validity, 272 mothers of the NHSII participants were asked to report information on their daughters' adolescent diets using the HS-FFQ. In this comparison, the mean Pearson correlation was 0.40 (range, 0.13-0.59) for nutrients, and the mean Spearman rank correlation for foods was 0.30 (range, 0.10-0.61). While further studies are warranted, these findings imply that this food frequency questionnaire provides a reasonable record of adolescent diet.},

This study was aimed to reconstruct precise conductivity images from multiple voltage measurements in different patterns of the combination of current and voltage electrodes. We examined two voltage measuring patterns using electrodes located at upper and lower levels around the abdomen of a subject. In the experiment, after 1024 voltage data were taken from one specified voltage measurement pattern, another 1024 data were also taken continuously using another pattern. The reconstruction of conductivity image was made using entire data. As a result, the tomography image was improved compared with the image obtained from single voltage measurement pattern. We then obtained the histogram of the conductivities and estimated the area of abdominal fat. The present method using multiple voltage measurement patterns would be effective, if the measuring time can be much reduced through future modification of the tomography device.},

abstract = {Objective: To use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in craniopharyngioma (CP) patients to examine the hypothesis that hypothalamic damage due to CP and its treatment results in enhanced perception of food reward and/or impaired central satiety processing. Methods: Pre- and post-meal responses to visual food cues in brain regions of interest (ROI; bilateral nucleus accumbens, bilateral insula, and medial orbitofrontal cortex) were assessed in 4 CP patients versus 4 age- and weight-matched controls. Stimuli consisted of images of high- ('fattening') and low-calorie ('non-fattening') foods in blocks, alternating with non-food object blocks. After the first fMRI scan, subjects drank a high-calorie test meal to suppress appetite, then completed a second fMRI scan. Within each ROI, we calculated mean z-scores for activation by fattening as compared to non-fattening food images. Results: Following the test meal, controls showed suppression of activation by food cues while CP patients showed trends towards higher activation. Conclusion: These data, albeit in a small group of patients, support our hypothesis that perception of food cues may be altered in hypothalamic obesity (HO), especially after eating, i.e. in the satiated state. The fMRI approach is encouraging for performing future mechanistic studies of the brain response to food cues and satiety in patients with hypothalamic or other forms of childhood obesity.

abstract = {The article discusses the discretization of linear inverse problems. When an inverse problem is formulated in terms of infinite-dimensional function spaces and then discretized for computational purposes, a discretization error appears. Since inverse problems are typically ill-posed, neglecting this error may have serious consequences to the quality of the reconstruction. The Bayesian paradigm provides tools to estimate the statistics of the discretization error that is made part of the measurement and modelling errors of the estimation problem. This approach also provides tools to reduce the dimensionality of inverse problems in a controlled manner. The ideas are demonstrated with a computed example. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regression to the mean (RTM) is a statistical phenomenon that can make natural variation in repeated data look like real change. It happens when unusually large or small measurements tend to be followed by measurements that are closer to the mean. METHODS: We give some examples of the phenomenon, and discuss methods to overcome it at the design and analysis stages of a study. RESULTS: The effect of RTM in a sample becomes more noticeable with increasing measurement error and when follow-up measurements are only examined on a sub-sample selected using a baseline value. CONCLUSIONS: RTM is a ubiquitous phenomenon in repeated data and should always be considered as a possible cause of an observed change. Its effect can be alleviated through better study design and use of suitable statistical methods.},

abstract = {The cutaneous senses are traditionally thought to comprise four recognized submodalities that relay tactile, thermal, painful and pruritic (itch) information to the central nervous system, but there is growing evidence for the presence of a fifth modality that conveys positive affective (pleasant) properties of touch. Cutaneous sensory channels can be further classified as serving predominantly either discriminative or affective functions. The former provides information about the spatial and temporal localisation of events on the body surface, e.g., the presence of an insect or the temperature of a cold wind; and the latter, although widely recognised as providing the afferent neural input driving the negative emotional experience of pain, is here posited to provide the afferent neural input driving the positive emotional experience of affiliative touch as well. A distinction is made between the properties of fast conducting myelinated afferents and those of slowly conducting unmyelinated afferents, with the former subserving a sensory-discriminative role, and the latter an affective-motivational one. Here we review the basic elements of the somatosensory system and outline evidence for the inclusion of the 'fifth' sub-modality, conveyed by low-threshold C-fiber mechanoreceptors as the counterpart of high-threshold C-fiber nociceptors with both C-fiber systems serving opposing aspects of affective touch, yet underpining a common mechanism for the preservation of self and species. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging technique that attempts to reconstruct the impedance distribution inside an object from the impedance between electrodes placed on the object surface. The EIT reconstruction problem can be approached as a nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem in which one tries to maximize the matching between a simulated impedance problem and the observed data. This nonlinear optimization problem is often ill-posed, and not very suited to methods that evaluate derivatives of the objective function. It may be approached by simulated annealing (SA), but at a large computational cost due to the expensive evaluation process of the objective function, which involves a full simulation of the impedance problem at each iteration. A variation of SA is proposed in which the objective function is evaluated only partially, while ensuring boundaries on the behavior of the modified algorithm.},

We give a precise characterization of the effect of this hierarchy constraint, prove that hierarchy holds with probability one and derive an unbiased estimate for the degrees of freedom of our estimator. A bound on this estimate reveals the amount of fitting "saved" by the hierarchy constraint. We distinguish between parameter sparsity - the number of nonzero coefficients - and practical sparsity - the number of raw variables one must measure to make a new prediction. Hierarchy focuses on the latter, which is more closely tied to important data collection concerns such as cost, time and effort. We develop an algorithm, available in the R package hierNet, and perform an empirical study of our method.},

abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), often concomitant with obesity, increases the risk for the metabolic syndrome. One mechanism that may participate in this association is upregulation of inflammatory pathways. We used structural equation modeling to assess the interrelations between childhood obesity, OSA, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. One hundred and eighty-four children (127 boys, mean age: 8.5 +/- 4.1 years) had height and weight measured, underwent overnight polysomnography and had fasting blood taken. The blood was analyzed for insulin, glucose, lipids, leptin, and cytokines [interferon (IFN)-gamma, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha]. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate associations between the outcomes of interest including hypoxia, arousal (related to respiratory and spontaneous), obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammatory markers. Two cytokine factors and one metabolic factor were derived for the SEM. These factors provided good fit in the structural equation model (chi(2)/df = 2.855; comparative fit index = 0.90, root mean squared error of approximation = 0.10) and all factor loadings were significantly different from zero (P {\textless} or = 0.01). Overall, our results indicate that while obesity (as measured by body mass index z-score) has a major influence on the metabolic dysfunction associated with OSA, arousal indices, and cytokine markers may also influence this association. Our results support the hypothesis that OSA is a contributor to the mechanisms that link sleep, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, and show that the interrelations may begin in childhood.},

A randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover study was performed in subjects with normal or moderately high fasting serum TG levels. Subjects ingested 0.00 g [control: triacylglycerol; TAG (rapeseed oil)], 1.25 g (1.25-g: mixture of 1.25 g ALA-DAG and 1.25 g TAG), or 2.50 g (2.50 g) of ALA-DAG in random order with a 6-d washout period. Serum TG levels were evaluated in the fasting state, and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after the test meal. Thirty-eight subjects completed the study and were defined as the per protocol set. As the primary outcome, postprandial serum TG levels were significantly lower in the 2.50-g treatment compared with the control. The TG level did not differ significantly between the 1.25-g and control. The suppressive effect of ALA-DAG on the serum TG level correlated significantly with the body mass index and fasting insulin level. ALA-DAG at a dose of 2.50 g had greater effects on serum TG and apolipoprotein B levels in subjects with a higher body mass index ({\textgreater}/=25 kg/m2) and higher fasting serum insulin levels ({\textgreater}10 muU/mL). Our findings suggest that ingesting 2.50 g ALA-DAG suppresses the postprandial serum TG level in people with normal and moderately high fasting serum TG levels, presumably as a result of poor re-esterification of dietary fat into TG in the intestinal mucosa.},

I present a minimal ecosystem model with explicit energy and matter conservation. Energy is captured and stored via synthesis and release through decomposition. This energy is used for biomass production and maintenance. I examine materially closed systems where growth is limited by nutrient availability. I present two key findings. First, maximum biomass production does not occur under conditions of equal nutrient concentrations. Instead, production is maximized when the initial environmental concentration of the energy carrying substrate is increased. Second, the system is characterized by an abrupt collapse when the concentration of the energy carrying substrate is increased above a threshold. This model indicates that in the region of maximum biomass production, ecosystems are fragile rather than resilient. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Shape-based solutions have recently received attention for certain ill-posed inverse problems. Their advantages include implicit imposition of relevant constraints and reduction in the number of unknowns, especially important for nonlinear ill-posed problems. We apply the shape-based approach to current-injection electrical impedance tomography (EIT) reconstructions. We employ a boundary element method (BEM) based solution for EIT. We introduce two shape models, one based on modified B-splines, and the other based on spherical harmonics, for BEM modeling of shapes. These methods allow us to parameterize the geometry of conductivity inhomogeneities in the interior of the volume. We assume the general shape of piecewise constant inhomogeneities is known but their conductivities and their exact location and shape is not. We also assume the internal conductivity profile is piecewise constant, meaning that each region has a constant conductivity. We propose and test three different regularization techniques to be used with either of the shape models. The performance of our methods is illustrated via both simulations in a digital torso model and phantom experiments when there is a single internal object. We observe that in the noisy environment, either simulated noise or real sources of noise in the experimental study, we get reasonable reconstructions. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expected in modern EIT instruments is higher than that used in this study, these reconstruction methods may prove useful in practice.},

abstract = {Although abdominal obesity or visceral obesity is considered to be one of the components of metabolic syndrome and to have an important role in a cluster of cardiovascular risks, there is no consensus about the definition and diagnostic criteria for this syndrome, probably because there is considerable disagreement about the location and definition of abdominal obesity or visceral obesity.In this review article, the important role of visceral fat accumulation in the development of a variety of lifestyle-related diseases is shown, including cardiovascular disease based on our clinical studies using CT scans, and the mechanism of these disorders is discussed, focusing on adipocytokines, especially adiponectin.The importance of diagnosing metabolic syndrome, in which visceral fat accumulation plays an essential role in the development of multiple risk factors, should be emphasized because lifestyle modification for the reduction of visceral fat may be very effective for the reduction of risks of this type, namely metabolic syndrome in the narrow sense.},
