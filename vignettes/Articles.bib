abstract = {To elucidate the function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in taste encoding, it is worth applying to taste, the psychological paradigms of intentional memorization that have been used with other extensively studied senses, and thus updating current models for LPFC functions to include a taste modality. Using multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we examined the LPFC's of healthy volunteers (N??=??18) during the intentional memorization of a basic taste. In order to minimize the confounding effects of verbal processes that are known to employ the left LPFC, we used quaternary taste mixtures that were difficult to verbalize, and confined analysis to those who did not use a verbal strategy during memorization (N??=??10). In order to examine the results in association with data in the literature, the location of activity was probabilistically estimated and anatomically labeled in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard brain space. By contrasting the cortical activation under encoding conditions with that under control conditions without memory requirement, we found activation in the bilateral ventro-LPFC and the right posterior portion of the LPFC. The activation pattern was consistent with previous studies on the encoding of nonverbal materials using other senses. This suggests that models for LPFC functions that derive from previous studies can be generalized to intentional encoding processes of taste information, at least at a macro-structural level. The current study also demonstrates that, by using fNIRS, LPFC functions on taste can be examined with experimental paradigms relevant to those used for other senses. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that early intervention of vitamin A-enriched diet contains the development of obesity and improves insulin resistance, 50-day-old male lean and obese rats of WNIN/Ob strain were given either stock diet (2.6 mg vitamin A/kg diet) or vitamin A-enriched diet (129 mg vitamin A/kg diet) for 3 months. Compared with stock diet-fed obese rats, vitamin A-enriched diet-fed obese rats had reduced body weight gain, visceral adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity as evidenced by decreased fasting plasma insulin and unaltered glucose levels, which could possibly be due to higher phosphorylation of soleus muscle insulin receptor. This in turn is explained by decreased protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) levels. Most of these changes were not observed in lean rats. In conclusion, chronic feeding of vitamin A-enriched diet to obese rats at an early age ameliorates visceral adiposity and improves the insulin sensitivity, possibly by decreasing soleus muscle PTP1B levels.},

abstract = {This study was aimed to examine the cross-sectional association of protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake with depressive symptoms among 1794 Japanese male workers aged 18-69 years who participated in a health survey. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Odds ratio of depressive symptoms (CES-D scale of ≥16) was estimated by using multiple logistic regression with adjustment for covariates including folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, polyunsaturated fatty acid, magnesium, and iron intake. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of depressive symptoms for the highest quartile of protein intake was 26{\%}, albeit not statistically significant, lower compared with the lowest. The inverse association was more evident when a cutoff value of CES-D score ≥19 was used. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) for the highest through lowest quartile of protein intake were 1.00 (reference), 0.69 (0.47-1.01), 0.69 (0.44-1.09), and 0.58 (0.31-1.06) (P for trend=0.096). Neither carbohydrate nor fat intake was associated with depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that low protein intake may be associated with higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japanese male workers.},

abstract = {Assessing the performance of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems usually requires a phantom for validation, calibration, or comparison purposes. This paper describes a resistive mesh phantom to assess the performance of EIT systems while taking into account cabling stray effects similar to in vivo conditions. This phantom is built with 340 precision resistors on a printed circuit board representing a 2-D circular homogeneous medium. It also integrates equivalent electrical models of the Ag/AgCl electrode impedances. The parameters of the electrode models were fitted from impedance curves measured with an impedance analyzer. The technique used to build the phantom is general and applicable to phantoms of arbitrary shape and conductivity distribution. We describe three performance indicators that can be measured with our phantom for every measurement of an EIT data frame: SNR, accuracy, and modeling accuracy. These performance indicators were evaluated on our EIT system under different frame rates and applied current intensities. The performance indicators are dependent on frame rate, operating frequency, applied current intensity, measurement strategy, and intermodulation distortion when performing simultaneous measurements at several frequencies. These parameter values should, therefore, always be specified when reporting performance indicators to better appreciate their significance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Observational studies report that influenza vaccination reduces winter mortality risk from any cause by 50{\%} among the elderly. Influenza vaccination coverage among elderly persons ({\textgreater} or =65 years) in the United States increased from between 15{\%} and 20{\%} before 1980 to 65{\%} in 2001. Unexpectedly, estimates of influenza-related mortality in this age group also increased during this period. We tried to reconcile these conflicting findings by adjusting excess mortality estimates for aging and increased circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses. METHODS We used a cyclical regression model to generate seasonal estimates of national influenza-related mortality (excess mortality) among the elderly in both pneumonia and influenza and all-cause deaths for the 33 seasons from 1968 to 2001. We stratified the data by 5-year age group and separated seasons dominated by A(H3N2) viruses from other seasons. RESULTS For people aged 65 to 74 years, excess mortality rates in A(H3N2)-dominated seasons fell between 1968 and the early 1980s but remained approximately constant thereafter. For persons 85 years or older, the mortality rate remained flat throughout. Excess mortality in A(H1N1) and B seasons did not change. All-cause excess mortality for persons 65 years or older never exceeded 10{\%} of all winter deaths. CONCLUSIONS We attribute the decline in influenza-related mortality among people aged 65 to 74 years in the decade after the 1968 pandemic to the acquisition of immunity to the emerging A(H3N2) virus. We could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group. Because fewer than 10{\%} of all winter deaths were attributable to influenza in any season, we conclude that observational studies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit.},

abstract = {Body weight is known to be associated with bone mass, however, it is unclear whether body composition, as reflected by the percent of total weight that is fat tissue ({\%}fat), is associated with bone mass independently of weight. Fat tissue is metabolically active, and hormonal factors may mediate an association of {\%}fat with bone mass. Leptin, a hormone produced in fat tissue, has recently been shown to be inversely related to bone mass in mice, but whether it is related to human bone mass is uncertain. We sought to investigate the associations of {\%}fat and of serum leptin concentration with bone mineral density (BMD) in a cohort of 153 premenopausal women. BMD measurements of the total hip, lumbar spine and total body as well as body composition were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Serum leptin levels were established using a commercial competitive binding assay. Individually, body weight, {\%}fat and leptin were each positively associated with BMD at all three sites. However, when we examined BMD either as a function of both body weight and {\%}fat together, or as a function of both body weight and leptin together, we found that for a given body weight, BMD appeared to be inversely associated with {\%}fat and similarly appeared to be inversely associated with leptin. When BMD was examined as a function of {\%}fat and leptin together, we found that for a given {\%}fat, leptin appeared to be inversely associated with BMD. In summary, the results of this study suggest that for a given body weight, a higher proportion of fat and a higher serum leptin concentration have negative associations with bone mass in premenopausal women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous controlled studies on the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) - namely the use of facemasks and intensified hand hygiene - in preventing household transmission of influenza have not produced definitive results. We aimed to investigate efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of NPI in households with influenza index patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial during the pandemic season 2009/10 and the ensuing influenza season 2010/11. We included households with an influenza positive index case in the absence of further respiratory illness within the preceding 14 days. Study arms were wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group). Main outcome measure was laboratory confirmed influenza infection in a household contact. We used daily questionnaires to examine adherence and tolerability of the interventions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We recruited 84 households (30 control, 26 M and 28 MH households) with 82, 69 and 67 household contacts, respectively. In 2009/10 all 41 index cases had a influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection, in 2010/11 24 had an A (H1N1) pdm09 and 20 had a B infection. The total secondary attack rate was 16{\%} (35/218). In intention-to-treat analysis there was no statistically significant effect of the M and MH interventions on secondary infections. When analysing only households where intervention was implemented within 36 h after symptom onset of the index case, secondary infection in the pooled M and MH groups was significantly lower compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.16, 95{\%} CI, 0.03-0.92). In a per-protocol analysis odds ratios were significantly reduced among participants of the M group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30, 95{\%} CI, 0.10-0.94). With the exception of MH index cases in 2010/11 adherence was good for adults and children, contacts and index cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently. Concerns about acceptability and tolerability of the interventions should not be a reason against their recommendation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT00833885).},

@article{Cao_2011_21676245,
abstract = {Obesity is traditionally viewed to be beneficial to bone health because of well-established positive effect of mechanical loading conferred by body weight on bone formation, despite being a risk factor for many other chronic health disorders. Although body mass has a positive effect on bone formation, whether the mass derived from an obesity condition or excessive fat accumulation is beneficial to bone remains controversial. The underline pathophysiological relationship between obesity and bone is complex and continues to be an active research area. Recent data from epidemiological and animal studies strongly support that fat accumulation is detrimental to bone mass. To our knowledge, obesity possibly affects bone metabolism through several mechanisms. Because both adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from a common multipotential mesenchymal stem cell, obesity may increase adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation while decrease osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation. The increased circulating and tissue proinflammatory cytokines in obesity may promote osteoclast activity and bone resorption through modifying the receptor activator of NF-$\kappa$B (RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin pathway. Furthermore, the excessive secretion of leptin and/or decreased production of adiponectin by adipocytes in obesity may either directly affect bone formation or indirectly affect bone resorption through up-regulated proinflammatory cytokine production. Finally, high-fat intake may interfere with intestinal calcium absorption and therefore decrease calcium availability for bone formation. Unraveling the relationship between fat and bone metabolism at molecular level may help us to develop therapeutic agents to prevent or treat both obesity and osteoporosis. Obesity, defined as having a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2, is a condition in which excessive body fat accumulates to a degree that adversely affects health. The rates of obesity rates have doubled since 1980 and as of 2007, 33{\%} of men and 35{\%} of women in the US are obese. Obesity is positively associated to many chronic disorders such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers. It is estimated that the direct medical cost associated with obesity in the United States is {\~{}}{\$}100 billion per year.Bone mass and strength decrease during adulthood, especially in women after menopause. These changes can culminate in osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration resulting in increased bone fracture risk. It is estimated that there are about 10 million Americans over the age of 50 who have osteoporosis while another 34 million people are at risk of developing the disease. In 2001, osteoporosis alone accounted for some {\$}17 billion in direct annual healthcare expenditure. Several lines of evidence suggest that obesity and bone metabolism are interrelated. First, both osteoblasts (bone forming cells) and adipocytes (energy storing cells) are derived from a common mesenchymal stem cell and agents inhibiting adipogenesis stimulated osteoblast differentiation and vice versa, those inhibiting osteoblastogenesis increased adipogenesis. Second, decreased bone marrow osteoblastogenesis with aging is usually accompanied with increased marrow adipogenesis. Third, chronic use of steroid hormone, such as glucocorticoid, results in obesity accompanied by rapid bone loss. Fourth, both obesity and osteoporosis are associated with elevated oxidative stress and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. At present, the mechanisms for the effects of obesity on bone metabolism are not well defined and will be the focus of this review.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the ability to produce equol, a metabolite of the soya isoflavone daidzein, is beneficial to coronary health. Equol, generated by bacterial action on isoflavones in the human gut, is biologically more potent than dietary sources of isoflavones. Not all humans are equol producers. We investigated whether equol-producing status is favourably associated with risk factors for CHD following an intervention by dietary soya isoflavones. We systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCT) that evaluated the effect of soya isoflavones on risk factors for CHD and that reported equol-producing status. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid Medline and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials published up to April 2015 and hand-searched bibliographies to identify the RCT. Characteristics of participants and outcomes measurements were extracted and qualitatively analysed. From a total of 1671 studies, we identified forty-two articles that satisfied our search criteria. The effects of equol on risk factors for CHD were mainly based on secondary analyses in these studies, thus with inadequate statistical power. Although fourteen out of the forty-two studies found that equol production after a soya isoflavone intervention significantly improved a range of risk factors including cholesterol and other lipids, inflammation and blood pressure variables, these results need further verification by sufficiently powered studies. The other twenty-eight studies primarily reported null results. RCT of equol, which has recently become available as a dietary supplement, on CHD and its risk factors are awaited.},

abstract = {The Longini-Koopman model (1982, Biometrics 38, 115-126) describes the process underlying the transmission of an infectious disease in terms of household and community level transmission probabilities. This model is generalized by allowing for different transmission probabilities that may correspond to various levels of risk factors on both the household and community levels. Two types of models are considered: (i) models for household data, where the numbers of susceptible and infected members in each household are known along with the values of household level risk factors; and (ii) models for individual data, where the infection status and risk factor level are known for each individual in the household. Although the type (i) models can be expressed as special cases of the type (ii) models, they deserve special attention as they can be represented and analyzed as log-linear models. Both types of models can be analyzed using maximum likelihood methods, while the type (i) models, when expressed as log-linear models, can also be analyzed by the weighted least squares method. Data from influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan and Seattle, Washington are used to illustrate these methods.},

abstract = {It is well known in the literature that the problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks is very hard to tackle: its computational complexity is super-exponential in the number of nodes in the worst case and polynomial in most real-world scenarios. Efficient implementations of score-based structure learning benefit from past and current research in optimisation theory, which can be adapted to the task by using the network score as the objective function to maximise. This is not true for approaches based on conditional independence tests, called constraint-based learning algorithms. The only optimisation in widespread use, backtracking, leverages the symmetries implied by the definitions of neighbourhood and Markov blanket. In this paper we illustrate how backtracking is implemented in recent versions of the bnlearn R package, and how it degrades the stability of Bayesian network structure learning for little gain in terms of speed. As an alternative, we describe a software architecture and framework that can be used to parallelise constraint-based structure learning algorithms (also implemented in bnlearn) and we demonstrate its performance using four reference networks and two real-world data sets from genetics and systems biology. We show that on modern multi-core or multiprocessor hardware parallel implementations are preferable over backtracking, which was developed when single-processor machines were the norm.},

abstract = {High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a new in vivo imaging technique for assessing 3D microstructure of cortical and trabecular bone at the distal radius and tibia. No studies have investigated the extent to which measurements of the peripheral skeleton by HR-pQCT reflect those of the spine and hip, where the most serious fractures occur. To address this research question, we performed dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), central QCT (cQCT), HR-pQCT, and image-based finite-element analyses on 69 premenopausal women to evaluate relationships among cortical and trabecular bone density, geometry, microstructure, and stiffness of the lumbar spine, proximal femur, distal radius, and distal tibia. Significant correlations were found between the stiffness of the two peripheral sites (r = 0.86), two central sites (r = 0.49), and between the peripheral and central skeletal sites (r = 0.56-0.70). These associations were explained in part by significant correlations in areal bone mineral density (aBMD), volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), and cross-sectional area (CSA) between the multiple skeletal sites. For the prediction of proximal femoral stiffness, vBMD (r = 0.75) and stiffness (r = 0.69) of the distal tibia by HR-pQCT were comparable with direct measurements of the proximal femur: aBMD of the hip by DXA (r = 0.70) and vBMD of the hip by cQCT (r = 0.64). For the prediction of vertebral stiffness, trabecular vBMD (r = 0.58) and stiffness (r = 0.70) of distal radius by HR-pQCT were comparable with direct measurements of lumbar spine: aBMD by DXA (r = 0.78) and vBMD by cQCT (r = 0.67). Our results suggest that bone density and microstructural and mechanical properties measured by HR-pQCT of the distal radius and tibia reflect the mechanical competence of the central skeleton.},

abstract = {AIM To investigate the clinical and biochemical factors associated with visceral fat accumulation in the general population. METHODS We enrolled 1004 subjects who underwent a medical health checkup between April 2008 and March 2009. The medical health checkup included the following tests: Height, body weight, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, urinalysis, blood-cell counts, blood chemistry, electrocardiography, chest radiography, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) for visceral fat accumulation. The patients' medical history and lifestyle factors were collected privately by nurses using a self-administered questionnaire, and they included questions regarding physical activity, sleep duration, dietary habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Visceral fat area (VFA) was defined as the sum of the intraperitoneal fat area at the level of the umbilicus with CT density in the range of -150 to -50 Hounsfield units. RESULTS The mean age and body mass index (BMI) of the study subjects were 57.0 years and 24.4 kg/m(2). In both male and females, VFA was significantly and positively correlated with WC (r = 0.532, P {\textless} 0.01; r = 0.612, P {\textless} 0.01). Subjects with high levels of VFA were primarily male with significantly higher age, height, body weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, and hemoglobin in all subjects (P {\textless} 0.05). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that VFA had a positive relationship with age ≥ 56, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2), and triglyceride level ≥ 149 in males (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas it had a positive relationship with age ≥ 58, BMI ≥ 24.4 kg/m(2), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level {\textless} 40 mg/dL, and current drinking in females (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION These results suggest that gender differences exist in the clinical and biochemical parameters associated with visceral fat accumulation.},

abstract = {A highly versatile Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system, nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The system allows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. Current is injected using a Keithley 6221 current source, and voltages are recorded with a 24-bit EEG system with minimum bandwidth of 3.2 kHz. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering of external stimuli. The performance of the system was characterised using resistor phantoms to represent human scalp recordings, with an SNR of 77.5 dB, stable across a four hour recording and 20 Hz to 20 kHz. In studies of both haeomorrhage using scalp electrodes, and evoked activity using epicortical electrode mats in rats, it was possible to reconstruct images matching established literature at known areas of onset. Data collected using scalp electrode in humans matched known tissue impedance spectra and was stable over frequency. The experimental procedure is software controlled and is readily adaptable to new paradigms. Where possible, commercial or open-source components were used, to minimise the complexity in reproduction. The hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication.},

abstract = {The "metabolic syndrome" (MetS) is a clustering of components that reflect overnutrition, sedentary lifestyles, and resultant excess adiposity. The MetS includes the clustering of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure and is associated with other comorbidities including the prothrombotic state, proinflammatory state, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and reproductive disorders. Because the MetS is a cluster of different conditions, and not a single disease, the development of multiple concurrent definitions has resulted. The prevalence of the MetS is increasing to epidemic proportions not only in the United States and the remainder of the urbanized world but also in developing nations. Most studies show that the MetS is associated with an approximate doubling of cardiovascular disease risk and a 5-fold increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although it is unclear whether there is a unifying pathophysiological mechanism resulting in the MetS, abdominal adiposity and insulin resistance appear to be central to the MetS and its individual components. Lifestyle modification and weight loss should, therefore, be at the core of treating or preventing the MetS and its components. In addition, there is a general consensus that other cardiac risk factors should be aggressively managed in individuals with the MetS. Finally, in 2008 the MetS is an evolving concept that continues to be data driven and evidence based with revisions forthcoming},

Forty-four subjects (men, n = 22; women, n = 22) were randomly assigned into two groups: one received placebo tablets (placebo group, n = 22 [men, n = 11; women, n = 11]), while the other received MFGM tablets (MFGM group, n = 22 [men, n = 11; women, n = 11]). The subjects ingested either MFGM (1 g/day) or placebo (1 g/day of whole milk powder) tablets every day for the 10-week study period and engaged in an exercise training program twice per week. A physical function test was performed at baseline and at 5 and 10 weeks. A significant group-by-time interaction was found for the side step test, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). In the placebo group, there were no significant intragroup differences. In the MFGM group, side step score and muscle CSA were significantly greater at 10 weeks compared to the baseline, and MFCV was significantly higher than that in the placebo group at 10 weeks. The changes in percentage of the side step score, muscle CSA, and MFCV in the MFGM group were significantly higher than in the placebo group at 10 weeks. These results suggest that daily MFGM ingestion combined with regular exercise might enhance physical performance such as agility in middle-aged adults.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that adipose tissue may negatively impact bone health, challenging the traditional paradigm that increased fat mass, through mechanical loading or endogenous estrogen production, is beneficial to the skeleton. We hypothesized that it is primarily the visceral compartment of body fat that is detrimental to bone metabolism, resulting in impaired bone density and architecture. In an age-stratified population sample of 218 women and 291 men (age 20-97 years), we assessed visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue areas at the L2-L3 interspace level by single slice quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and measured total body fat mass (TBF) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We then correlated these findings with volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) assessed by central QCT, and with vBMD and microstructural parameters at the ultradistal radius (UDR) by high resolution peripheral QCT (HRpQCT). In unadjusted analyses in postmenopausal women, TBF and SAT were positively correlated with total, trabecular, and cortical vBMD at the FN, LS, and UDR and with trabecular microstructure at the UDR. By contrast, VAT was not correlated with vBMD at the FN or LS but was positively correlated with UDR total and trabecular vBMD but not cortical vBMD. Adjustment for age or for bioavailable estradiol and testosterone levels reduced these correlations, while adjustment for body weight eliminated most positive associations. Assessment of the VAT/SAT ratio, however, demonstrated a negative relationship with vBMD at the FN and LS in postmenopausal women, a relationship eliminated when adjusted for age. Correlations between skeletal parameters and adipose measurements in pre-menopausal women and older men were weaker and mostly non-significant. In younger men, VAT was negatively associated with vBMD, cortical thickness, and trabecular microstructure at the UDR, and with LS vBMD and FN cortical vBMD. These associations generally remained after adjustment, with some negative associations (e.g., UDR cortical area) being accentuated. Similar results were found when the VAT/SAT ratio was correlated with FN vBMD in younger men; in contrast, VAT/SAT was positively correlated with FN vBMD in older men and this relationship was strengthened by age-adjustment. Together, our data suggest that adiposity has associations with bone that are age-, gender-, menopausal status-, adipose depot-, and bone compartment-specific. These novel observations warrant further investigations to establish any causal relationships.},

abstract = {Background: Suppression of gastric acid by proton pump inhibitors is associated with the increase of Lactobacillus in human gut microbiota. Gastric acid secretion is also suppressed by Helicobacter pylori infection and following atrophic gastritis. However, few studies have examined the association between H. pylori infection and Lactobacillus species in gut microbiota particularly in Japan. Methods: A total of 1,123 adult subjects who participated in a health survey in Hirosaki City were studied. Infection of H. pylori was defined by both serum antibody and stool antigen test. The presence and the severity of atrophic gastritis were defined by the serum level of serum pepsinogens. Using 16S ribosomal RNA amplification from fecal samples, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was calculated, and the composition ratio of each Lactobacillus species was surveyed. Results: The relative abundance of the Lactobacillus in H. pylori-infected subjects with severe atrophic gastritis was higher comparing with those in subjects with mild atrophic gastritis and without atrophic gastritis (0.591 vs 0.068{\%} and 0.033{\%}, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001) and also that of non-infected subjects (0.033{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). In H. pylori non-infected subjects, both gender and age were not associated with the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in fecal samples. The proportion of Lactobacillus salivarius was high in H. pylori-infected subjects while that of Lactobacillus acidophilus was high in non-infected subjects. Conclusion: Lactobacillus in human gut microbiota could be influenced by H. pylori infection and severity of atrophic gastritis in Japanese subjects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although dietary patterns have been linked to depression, a frequently observed precondition for suicide, no study has yet examined the association between dietary patterns and suicide risk. AIMS To prospectively investigate the association between dietary patterns and death from suicide. METHOD Participants were 40 752 men and 48 285 women who took part in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (1995-1998). Dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis of the consumption of 134 food and beverage items ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios of suicide from the fourth year of follow-up to December 2005 were calculated. RESULTS Among both men and women, a 'prudent' dietary pattern characterised by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, potatoes, soy products, mushrooms, seaweed and fish was associated with a decreased risk of suicide. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of suicide for the highest v. lowest quartiles of the dietary pattern score was 0.46 (95{\%} CI 0.28-0.75) (P for trend, 0.005). Other dietary patterns (Westernised and traditional Japanese) were not associated with suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that a prudent dietary pattern may be associated with a decreased risk of death from suicide.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The storage of adipose tissue in ectopic compartments is a hallmark attribute linking greater body mass index (BMI) with cardiometabolic diseases. Despite ample evidence to confirm that increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) deposition occurs with obesity, the interrelations between altered fat partitioning and regional muscle and bone quality are less well understood. OBJECTIVE We examined the association between adiposity and spinal muscle and bone quality across a large, heterogeneous cohort of adults. DESIGN We identified 8833 thoracic or abdominal computed tomography scans from patients in the University of Michigan Health System who were aged 18-64.9 y. We measured trabecular bone densities, cortical bone densities, VAT areas, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas at vertebral levels T7 to L5. Psoas muscle attenuation (an indicator of fat infiltration in muscle) was measured at the L4 level. RESULTS Muscle attenuation as well as trabecular and cortical bone densities revealed negative correlations with BMI, SAT, and VAT. The correlation between BMI and psoas attenuation was -0.321, between BMI and the density of cortical bone was -0.250, and between BMI and trabecular bone was -0.143 (all P {\textless} 0.001). However, correlations between VAT and lower muscle attenuation were stronger as were those between VAT and lower bone densities. Inverse correlations between VAT and densities of psoas muscle and cortical and trabecular bone were -0.460, -0.407, and -0.434, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). Even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, partial correlations between VAT, muscle attenuation, and bone densities remained significant at -0.250, -0.119, and -0.216, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Contrary to previous reports that high body mass is associated with increased bone quality, our data show a significant negative association between BMI and muscle and bone densities, suggesting fat infiltration into these tissues. More importantly, correlations between VAT and decreased bone and muscle densities remained statistically significant even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI.},

abstract = {Our previous study revealed the antihypertensive effects of green coffee bean extract (GCE) ingestion in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We suggested that this antihypertensive action was due to the fact that GCE contains chlorogenic acid (CQA) as a major phenolic compound, and CQA in turn contains ferulic acid as a metabolic component that acts on nitric oxide (NO) derived from the vascular endothelium. In this study, the effects of GCE on blood vessels were evaluated in healthy males. The subjects were 20 healthy males with reduced vasodilation responses measured by strain gauge plethysmograms (SPG) to ischemic reactive hyperemia. Of the 20 subjects, 10 (mean age, 37.2 years) ingested a test drink containing GCE (CQA: 140 mg/day), and the other 10 (mean age, 34.8 years) ingested a placebo drink for 4 months. During the ingestion period, SPG, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and serum biochemical parameters were measured, and acceleration plethysmograms (APG) were taken. The reactive hyperemia ratio (RHR) in the test drink group began to increase after ingestion for 1 month and was significantly higher (p {\textless}0.05) than that in the placebo group after ingestion for 3 months and 4 months. In addition, after ingestion for 4 months, the test drink group showed a significant decrease (p {\textless}0.01) in the plasma total homocysteine level compared with the pre-ingestion level. However, there were no significant differences in PWV or APG between the test drink group and the placebo drink group. The improvement in RHR after ingestion of a drink containing GCE suggested an improvement in vasoreactivity by this component.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There are few data on the comparative epidemiology and virology of the pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus and cocirculating seasonal influenza A viruses in community settings. METHODS We recruited 348 index patients with acute respiratory illness from 14 outpatient clinics in Hong Kong in July and August 2009. We then prospectively followed household members of 99 patients who tested positive for influenza A virus on rapid diagnostic testing. We collected nasal and throat swabs from all household members at three home visits within 7 days for testing by means of quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay and viral culture. Using hemagglutination-inhibition and viral-neutralization assays, we tested baseline and convalescent serum samples from a subgroup of patients for antibody responses to the pandemic and seasonal influenza A viruses. RESULTS Secondary attack rates (as confirmed on RT-PCR assay) among household contacts of index patients were similar for the pandemic influenza virus (8{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3 to 14) and seasonal influenza viruses (9{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 5 to 15). The patterns of viral shedding and the course of illness among index patients were also similar for the pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses. In a subgroup of patients for whom baseline and convalescent serum samples were available, 36{\%} of household contacts who had serologic evidence of pandemic influenza virus infection did not shed detectable virus or report illness. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus has characteristics that are broadly similar to those of seasonal influenza A viruses in terms of rates of viral shedding, clinical illness, and transmissibility in the household setting.},

abstract = {Obesity is associated with lower serum 25(OH)D level via several mechanisms including sequestration of fat soluble vitamin D in increased fat mass. Since obesity is the major cause of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, lower serum 25(OH)D level is also associated with these conditions. Non-surgical weight reduction, especially that results in decreased visceral fat mass, is associated with an improvement in insulin resistance and a small but significant increase in serum 25(OH)D level. Whether the latter is independently associated with the former is not known. Plural meta-analyses reported that vitamin D supplementation per se without life-style intervention is not associated with a significant weight reduction. However, recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in which large doses vitamin D over 2,000 IU/day supplemented to type 2 diabetes patients revealed a small but significant improvement in indices of insulin resistance and glycemic control. The beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism appeared to be more prominent in non-obese subjects in whom higher serum 25(OH)D level were attained, suggesting potential benefits of vitamin D on glucose metabolism is not mediated by weight or fat mass control.},

It is controversial whether effects of obesity on bone are mediated by increased bone resorption or decreased bone formation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate bone microarchitecture and remodeling in healthy premenopausal women of varying weights.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: We measured bone density and trunk fat by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 40 women and by computed tomography in a subset. Bone microarchitecture, stiffness, remodeling, and marrow fat were assessed in labeled transiliac bone biopsies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) ranged from 20.1 to 39.2 kg/m(2). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-trunk fat was directly associated with BMI (r = 0.78, P {\textless} .001) and visceral fat by computed tomography (r = 0.79, P {\textless} .001). Compared with women in the lowest tertile of trunk fat, those in the highest tertile had inferior bone quality: lower trabecular bone volume (20.4 ± 5.8 vs 29.1 ± 6.1{\%}; P = .001) and stiffness (433 ± 264 vs 782 ± 349 MPa; P = .01) and higher cortical porosity (8.8 ± 3.5 vs 6.3 ± 2.4{\%}; P = .049). Bone formation rate (0.004 ± 0.002 vs 0.011 ± 0.008 mm(2)/mm {\textperiodcentered} year; P = .006) was 64{\%} lower in the highest tertile.

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS Visceral fat (VF) compared with subcutaneous fat (SF) is more closely associated with cardiometabolic disease. Dietary vitamin A (retinol) may reduce adiposity through its effects on adipogenesis differentially in VF and SF, and this effect may be modulated by retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4). We investigated whether intake of vitamin A is associated with either VF or SF, and whether this association is moderated by the RBP4 genotype (rs10882272, C/T) previously associated with circulating retinol levels. METHODS This was a cross-sectional association study in a sample of 947 adolescents from a French-Canadian founder population. VF and SF were quantified with magnetic resonance imaging, and vitamin A intake was assessed with a 24-hour food recall. All participants were genotyped to determine their RBP4 variant. RESULTS Dietary intake of vitamin A was negatively associated with VF; however, it was not associated with SF. These relationships were independent of age, sex, height and energy intake, and were modulated by the RBP4 variant. The T allele promoted adiposity-reducing effects of vitamin A in VF and adiposity-enhancing effects in SF, while the C allele had adiposity-reducing effects in both VF and SF. CONCLUSIONS Dietary vitamin A may reduce abdominal adiposity and promote visceral to subcutaneous body fat redistribution during adolescence in an RBP4-dependent manner. These observational findings provide the basis for future interventional studies, which together with genetic information may inject further causality in the association between dietary vitamin A intake and abdominal adiposity.},

abstract = {Retinoids are vitamin A (retinol) derivatives and complex regulators of adipogenesis by activating specific nuclear receptors, including the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). Circulating retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and its membrane receptor STRA6 coordinate cellular retinol uptake. It is unknown whether retinol levels and the activity of RAR and RXR in adipocyte precursors are linked via RBP4/STRA6. Here, we show that STRA6 is expressed in precursor cells and, dictated by the apo- and holo-RBP4 isoforms, mediates bidirectional retinol transport that controls RAR$\alpha$ activity and subsequent adipocyte differentiation. Mobilization of retinoid stores in mice by inducing RBP4 secretion from the liver activated RAR$\alpha$ signaling in the precursor cell containing the stromal-vascular fraction of adipose tissue. Retinol-loaded holo-RBP4 blocked adipocyte differentiation of cultured precursors by activating RAR$\alpha$. Remarkably, retinol-free apo-RBP4 triggered retinol efflux that reduced cellular retinoids, RAR$\alpha$ activity, and target gene expression and enhanced adipogenesis synergistically with ectopic STRA6. Thus, STRA6 in adipocyte precursor cells links nuclear RAR$\alpha$ activity to the circulating RBP4 isoforms, whose ratio in obese mice was shifted toward limiting the adipogenic potential of their precursors. This novel cross talk identifies a retinol-dependent metabolic function of RBP4 that may have important implications for the treatment of obesity.},

abstract = {Obesity has been traditionally considered to protect the skeleton against osteoporosis and fracture. Recently, body fat, specifically visceral adipose tissue (VAT), has been associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk for some types of fractures. We studied VAT and bone microarchitecture in 710 participants (58{\%} women, age 61.3 ± 7.7 years) from the Framingham Offspring cohort to determine whether cortical and trabecular BMD and microarchitecture differ according to the amount of VAT. VAT was measured from CT imaging of the abdomen. Cortical and trabecular BMD and microarchitecture were measured at the distal tibia and radius using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). We focused on 10 bone parameters: cortical BMD (Ct.BMD), cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD), cortical porosity (Ct.Po), cortical thickness (Ct.Th), cortical bone area fraction (Ct.A/Tt.A), trabecular density (Tb.BMD), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), total area (Tt.Ar), and failure load (FL) from micro-finite element analysis. We assessed the association between sex-specific quartiles of VAT and BMD, microarchitecture, and strength in all participants and stratified by sex. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and in women, menopausal status, then repeated adjusting for body mass index (BMI) or weight. At the radius and tibia, Ct.Th, Ct.A/Tt.A, Tb.BMD, Tb.N, and FL were positively associated with VAT (all p-trend {\textless}0.05), but no other associations were statistically significant except for higher levels of cortical porosity with higher VAT in the radius. Most of these associations were only observed in women, and were no longer significant when adjusting for BMI or weight. Higher amounts of VAT are associated with greater BMD and better microstructure of the peripheral skeleton despite some suggestions of significant deleterious changes in cortical measures in the non-weight bearing radius. Associations were no longer significant after adjustment for BMI or weight, suggesting that the effects of VAT may not have a substantial effect on the skeleton independent of BMI or weight. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the validation and verification of a machine-learning based Bayesian network of breast pathology co-occurrence. The present/not present occurrences of 29 common breast pathologies from 1631 pathology reports were used to build the network. All pathology reports were developed by a single pathologist. The resulting network has 25 diagnosis nodes interconnected by 40 arcs. Each arc represents a predicted co-occurrence or null co-occurrence. Model verification involved assessing the robustness of the original network structure after random exclusion of 25{\%}, 50{\%}, and 75{\%} of the pathology report dataset. The structure of the network appears stable as random removal of 75{\%} of the records in the original dataset leaves 81{\%} of the original network intact. Model validation was primarily assessed by review of the breast pathology literature for each arc in the network. Almost all network identified co-occurrences (95{\%}) have been published in the breast pathology literature or were verified by expert opinion. In conclusion, the Bayesian network of breast pathology co-occurrence presented here is both robust with respect to incomplete data and validated by consistency with the breast pathology literature and by expert opinion. Further, the ability to utilize a specific pathology observation to predict multiple co-current pathologies enables exploration of pathology co-occurrence patterns in an intuitive manner that may have broader application in both the breast pathologist clinical community and the breast cancer research community. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We identified two independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with circulating retinol levels, which are located near the transthyretin (TTR) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) genes which encode major carrier proteins of retinol: rs1667255 (P =2.30× 10(-17)) and rs10882272 (P =6.04× 10(-12)). We replicated the association with rs10882272 in RBP4 in independent samples from the Nurses' Health Study and the Invecchiare in Chianti Study (InCHIANTI) that included 3792 women and 504 men (P =9.49× 10(-5)), but found no association for retinol with rs1667255 in TTR among women, thus suggesting evidence for gender dimorphism (P-interaction=1.31× 10(-5)).

abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between muscle and bone status in elderly individuals. Our results suggested links between sarcopenia and osteoporosis; impairment in muscle status (i.e., muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance) is associated with deterioration in bone mass and texture subsequently leading to an increased risk of fracture. Introduction Accumulating evidence has shown associations between sarcopenia and osteoporosis, but existing studies face inconsistencies in the clinical definition of both conditions. Thus, we sought to investigate bone health among older individuals with or without muscle health impairment. Methods We conducted an analysis of cross-sectional data available from the Sarcopenia and Physical Impairment with Advancing Age (SarcoPhAge) study. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) (i.e., a low muscle mass plus either low muscle strength or low physical performance). Muscle mass and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Muscle strength was assessed using a hand dynamometer, and physical performance was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery test. Using the cutoff limits proposed by the EWGSOP, we have classified women in the Blow SMI group{\^{}} when its value was {\textless} 5.50 kg/m 2 , in the Blow muscle strength group{\^{}} when strength was {\textless} 20 kg, and in the Blow physical performance group{\^{}} when SPPB {\textless} 8 points. The thresholds of {\textless} 7.26 kg/m 2 (for SMI), {\textless} 30 kg (for muscle strength), and SPPB {\textless} 8 points were used for men. The 10-year fracture risk was obtained using the FRAX{\textregistered} tool. Moreover, bone texture was determined using the trabecular bone score (TBS) method. Results The study sample consisted of 288 older subjects aged 74.7 ± 5.7 years, and 59.0{\%} of the subjects were women. Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 43 individuals (14.9{\%}), and osteoporosis was diagnosed in 36 subjects (12.5{\%}). Moreover, aBMD values were, most of the time, lower in older men and women with muscle impairment (i.e., low muscle mass, low muscle strength, and low physical performance). For these subjects, we also noted a higher probability of fracture. When comparing bone quality, there were no significant differences in the TBS values between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older men and women or between those with low and high muscle mass. However, when controlling for confounders (i.e., age, BMI, number of co-morbidities, smoking status, and nutritional status), TBS values were lower in older women with low muscle strength (p = 0.04) and in older men with low physical performance (p = 0.01). Conclusions Our study showed interrelationships between components of sarcopenia and osteoporosis, with older subjects with muscle impairment having poorer bone health.},

abstract = {Childhood studies of the fat-bone relationship are conflicting, possibly reflecting the influence of metabolic abnormalities in some but not all obese children. Bone mass was compared between prepubertal overweight children with (n = 41) and without (n = 99) prediabetes. Associations of bone mass with measures of total and central adiposity, glucose intolerance, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, systemic inflammation, and osteocalcin also were determined. In 140 overweight children aged 7 to 11 years, an oral glucose tolerance test was used to identify those with prediabetes and for determination of glucose, 2-hour glucose, glucose area under the curve (AUC), insulin, 2-hour insulin, and insulin AUC. Blood samples also were assessed for lipids, C-reactive protein, and osteocalcin. Total-body bone mineral content (BMC), fat-free soft tissue mass (FFST), and fat mass (FM) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) were assessed using MRI. Total-body BMC was 4{\%} lower in overweight children with prediabetes than in those without prediabetes after controlling for sex, race, height, and weight (p = .03). In the total sample, FM was positively related with BMC ($\beta$ = 0.16, p = .01) after adjusting for sex, race, height, and FFST. However, VAT ($\beta$ = -0.13, p = .03) and SAAT ($\beta$ = -0.34, p = .02) were inversely associated with BMC after controlling for sex, race, height, FFST, FM, and SAAT or VAT. No significant associations were found between BMC and the biochemical measurements. Prepubertal overweight children with prediabetes may be at risk for poor skeletal development. In addition, it appears that greater levels of central rather than total adiposity may be deleterious for developing bone.},

abstract = {Objective: To test the association of endometrial cancer with the lymphotoxin-$\alpha$ (LT$\alpha$) C804A and A252G polymorphisms, a hospital-based incident case-control study was performed in Japanese subjects. Methods: The cases comprised 110 endometrial cancer patients, and the controls were 220 age-matched cancer-free females. Results: The LT$\alpha$ C804A and A252G polymorphisms were in complete linkage disequilibrium. We performed conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, which revealed that the LT$\alpha$ 252AG and 804CA variant genotypes were associated with a significantly reduced risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.51, 95{\%} CI = 0.31-0.86, P = 0.011). Being homozygous of the LT$\alpha$ 252G and 804A alleles was not associated with the risk of endometrial cancer. However, the presence of at least one variant LT$\alpha$ allele was associated with a significantly lower risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.54, 95{\%} CI = 0.33-0.87, P = 0.012). After adjusting for potential confounders (body mass index, age at menarche, parity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of endometrial cancer, hormone replacement therapy, smoking status, and alcohol consumption), the risk of endometrial cancer was significantly lower both in carriers of one variant allele and in carriers of either one or two of the variant alleles (OR = 0.47, 95{\%} CI = 0.26-0.85, P = 0.017; OR = 0.50, 95{\%} CI = 0.28-0.89, P = 0.019; respectively).

Background: A novel influenza virus has emerged to produce a global pandemic four times in the past one hundred years, resulting in millions of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. There is substantial uncertainty about when, where and how the next influenza pandemic will occur. Methods: We developed a novel mathematical model to chart the evolution of an influenza pandemic. We estimate the likely burden of future influenza pandemics through health and economic endpoints. An important component of this is the adequacy of existing hospital-resource capacity. Using a simulated population reflective of Ottawa, Using a simulated population reflective of Ottawa, Canada, we model the potential impact of a future influenza pandemic under different combinations of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Results: There was substantial variation in projected pandemic impact and outcomes across intervention scenarios. In a population of 1.2 million, the illness attack rate ranged from 8.4{\%} (all interventions) to 54.5{\%} (no interventions); peak acute care hospital capacity ranged from 0.2{\%} (all interventions) to 13.8{\%} (no interventions); peak ICU capacity ranged from 1.1{\%} (all interventions) to 90.2{\%} (no interventions); and mortality ranged from 11 (all interventions) to 363 deaths (no interventions). Associated estimates of economic burden ranged from CAD {\$}115 million to over {\$}2 billion when extended mass school closure was implemented. Discussion: Children accounted for a disproportionate number of pandemic infections, particularly in household settings. Pharmaceutical interventions effectively reduced peak and total pandemic burden without affecting timing, while non-pharmaceutical measures delayed and attenuated pandemic wave progression. The timely implementation of a layered intervention bundle appeared likely to protect hospital resource adequacy in Ottawa. The adaptable nature of this model provides value in informing pandemic preparedness policy planning in situations of uncertainty, as scenarios can be updated in real time as more data become available. However - given the inherent uncertainties of model assumptions - results should be interpreted with caution.},

@article{Krauchi2005,
abstract = {The purpose of our study was to understand the relationship between the components of the three-process model of sleepiness regulation (homeostatic, circadian, and sleep inertia) and the thermoregulatory system. This was achieved by comparing the impact of a 40-h sleep deprivation vs. a 40-h multiple nap paradigm (10 cycles with 150/75 min wakefulness/sleep episodes) on distal and proximal skin temperatures, core body temperature (CBT), melatonin secretion, subjective sleepiness, and nocturnal sleep EEG slow-wave activity in eight healthy young men in a "controlled posture" protocol. The main finding of the study was that accumulation of sleep pressure increased subjective sleepiness and slow-wave activity during the succeeding recovery night but did not influence the thermoregulatory system as measured by distal, proximal, and CBT. The circadian rhythm of sleepiness (and proximal temperature) was significantly correlated and phase locked with CBT, whereas distal temperature and melatonin secretion were phase advanced (by 113 +/- 28 and 130 +/- 30 min, respectively; both P {\textless} 0.005). This provides evidence for a primary role of distal vasodilatation in the circadian regulation of CBT and its relationship with sleepiness. Specific thermoregulatory changes occur at lights off and on. After lights off, skin temperatures increased and were most pronounced for distal; after lights on, the converse occurred. The decay in distal temperature (vasoconstriction) was significantly correlated with the disappearance of sleep inertia. These effects showed minor and nonsignificant circadian modulation. In summary, the thermoregulatory system seems to be independent of the sleep homeostat, but the circadian modulation of sleepiness and sleep inertia is clearly associated with thermoregulatory changes.},

abstract = {A cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which occur together more often than by chance alone, have become known as the metabolic syndrome. The risk factors include raised blood pressure, dyslipidemia (raised triglycerides and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), raised fasting glucose, and central obesity. Various diagnostic criteria have been proposed by different organizations over the past decade. Most recently, these have come from the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The main difference concerns the measure for central obesity, with this being an obligatory component in the International Diabetes Federation definition, lower than in the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria, and ethnic specific. The present article represents the outcome of a meeting between several major organizations in an attempt to unify criteria. It was agreed that there should not be an obligatory component, but that waist measurement would continue to be a useful preliminary screening tool. Three abnormal findings out of 5 would qualify a person for the metabolic syndrome. A single set of cut points would be used for all components except waist circumference, for which further work is required. In the interim, national or regional cut points for waist circumference can be used.},

This study evaluated the potential associations between vitamin A intake and several anthropometrical, biochemical and dietary features in healthy young adults, emphasizing the putative relationships between total antioxidant consumption and vitamin A intake. This translational research enrolled 61 healthy young adults aged 18-22 y. Anthropometrical and blood pressure measurements, blood samples and nutritional intake data were collected. After adjusting for total energy intake, vitamin A intake showed a negative correlation with several adiposity measurements. Furthermore, vitamin A consumption was positively associated with serum total cholesterol as well as with the intake of antioxidant foodstuffs. So, vitamin A intake seems to be related, not only with the total antioxidant intake, but also with several anthropometrical and biochemical measurements linked to metabolic syndrome manifestations and other features related to oxidative stress in healthy young adults.},

However, the IBSCs reported to date have been fabricated only by dry process and their efficiencies are limited, because their photo-absorption layers have low particle density of quantum dots, defects due to lattice strain, and low bandgap energy of bulk semiconductors. Here we present solution-processed IBSCs containing photo-absorption layers where lead sulfide quantum dots are densely dispersed in methylammonium lead bromide perovskite matrices with a high bandgap energy of 2.3 eV under undistorted conditions. We confirm that the present IBSCs exhibit two-step photon absorption via intermediate-band at room temperature by inter-subband photocurrent spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Background: Despite effective assessment methods and medications targeting osteoporosis and related fractures, screening for fracture risk is not currently advocated in the UK. We tested whether a community-based screening intervention could reduce fractures in older women. Methods: We did a two-arm randomised controlled trial in women aged 70-85 years to compare a screening programme using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) with usual management. Women were recruited from 100 general practitioner (GP) practices in seven regions of the UK: Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. We excluded women who were currently on prescription anti-osteoporotic drugs and any individuals deemed to be unsuitable to enter a research study (eg, known dementia, terminally ill, or recently bereaved). The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals who had one or more osteoporosis-related fractures over a 5-year period. In the screening group, treatment was recommended in women identified to be at high risk of hip fracture, according to the FRAX 10-year hip fracture probability. Prespecified secondary outcomes were the proportions of participants who had at least one hip fracture, any clinical fracture, or mortality; and the effect of screening on anxiety and health-related quality of life. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, number ISRCTN 55814835. Findings: 12 483 eligible women were identified and participated in the trial, and 6233 women randomly assigned to the screening group between April 15, 2008, and July 2, 2009. Treatment was recommended in 898 (14{\%}) of 6233 women. Use of osteoporosis medication was higher at the end of year 1 in the screening group compared with controls (15{\%} vs 4{\%}), with uptake particularly high (78{\%} at 6 months) in the screening high-risk subgroup. Screening did not reduce the primary outcome of incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures (hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}94, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}85-1{\textperiodcentered}03, p=0{\textperiodcentered}178), nor the overall incidence of all clinical fractures (0{\textperiodcentered}94, 0{\textperiodcentered}86-1{\textperiodcentered}03, p=0{\textperiodcentered}183), but screening reduced the incidence of hip fractures (0{\textperiodcentered}72, 0{\textperiodcentered}59-0{\textperiodcentered}89, p=0{\textperiodcentered}002). There was no evidence of differences in mortality, anxiety levels, or quality of life. Interpretation: Systematic, community-based screening programme of fracture risk in older women in the UK is feasible, and could be effective in reducing hip fractures.

abstract = {Intra-abdominal fat is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. Levels of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP4), secreted by fat and liver cells, are increased in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we report that, in 196 subjects, RBP4 is preferentially expressed in visceral (Vis) versus subcutaneous (SC) fat. Vis fat RBP4 mRNA was increased approximately 60-fold and 12-fold in Vis and SC obese subjects respectively versus lean subjects, and approximately 2-fold with impaired glucose tolerance/T2D subjects versus normoglycemic subjects. In obese subjects, serum RBP4 was increased 2- to 3-fold, and serum transthyretin, which stabilizes RBP4 in the circulation, was increased 35{\%}. Serum RBP4 correlated positively with adipose RBP4 mRNA and intra-abdominal fat mass and inversely with insulin sensitivity, independently of age, gender, and body mass index. RBP4 mRNA correlated inversely with GLUT4 mRNA in Vis fat and positively with adipocyte size in both depots. RBP4 levels are therefore linked to Vis adiposity, and Vis fat may be a major source of RBP4 in insulin-resistant states.},

abstract = {A stochastic infectious disease model was developed by Ball (1986, Advances in Applied Probability 18, 289-310) in which the distribution of the length of the infectious period is allowed to have any distribution that can be described by its Laplace transform. We extend this model such that the infection can be transmitted within the population or from an unspecified source outside the population. Also, discrete heterogeneity in the population can be modeled to incorporate variable susceptibility, variable infectivity, and/or mixing behaviors. The model is fitted to serologic data from two influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan, using maximum likelihood estimation procedures. The estimates show a clustering pattern by age groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Among adults, obesity has been positively related to bone mineral density. However, recent findings have pointed out that abdominal obesity could be negatively related to bone density. The above mentioned relationship is not clear among pediatric populations. Therefore, this cross-sectional study analyzed the relationship between thickness of abdominal adipose tissue and bone mineral variables in sedentary obese children and adolescents. METHODS One hundred and seventy five obese children and adolescents (83 male and 92 female) with ages ranging from 6 to 16 years-old were analyzed. Bone mineral content and density were estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and ultrasound equipment which estimated the thickness of the abdominal adipose tissue. Pubertal stage was self-reported by the participants. RESULTS The mean age was 11.1 (SD=2.6). Thickness of the abdominal adipose tissue was negatively related to bone mineral density (r=-0.17 [r95{\%}CI: -0.03;-0.32]), independent of gender, pubertal stage and other confounders ($\beta$=-0.134±0.042 [$\beta$95{\%}CI: -0.217; -0.050]). CONCLUSIONS In sedentary obese children and adolescents abdominal obesity is negatively related to bone mineral density, suggesting a potential link between abdominal obesity and osteoporosis.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The relationship between excess abdominal adipose tissue, metabolic and cardiovascular health risk has stimulated interest in the efficacy of physical activity in specifically perturbing this adipose depot. The evolution of imaging techniques has enabled more direct measurement of changes in abdominal and visceral fat. The purpose of this summary was to systematically review the relationship between physical activity and abdominal fat. METHODS: Database searches were performed on MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORT DISCUS and PUBMED, from 1985 to 2005 with keywords "exercise", "abdominal fat" and "visceral fat". RESULTS: Nineteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight non-randomized controlled trials were selected. In RCTs using imaging techniques to measure change in abdominal fat in overweight or obese subjects, seven out of 10 studies (including three trials with type 2 diabetics) reported significant reductions compared with controls. Reductions in visceral and total abdominal fat may occur in the absence of changes in body mass and waist circumference. Waist-to-hip ratio is not a sensitive measure of change in regional adiposity in exercise studies. No studies fulfil the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement's criteria for the highest quality of randomized trial; however, many studies were in progress or published before the opportunity to comply with these recommendations. Therefore, limited evidence from a number of studies suggests a beneficial influence of physical activity on reduction in abdominal and visceral fat in overweight and obese subjects when imaging techniques are used to quantify changes in abdominal adiposity. More rigorous studies are needed to confirm these observations.},

abstract = {People in Japan have the longest life expectancy at birth in the world. Here, we compile the best available evidence about population health in Japan to investigate what has made the Japanese people healthy in the past 50 years. The Japanese population achieved longevity in a fairly short time through a rapid reduction in mortality rates for communicable diseases from the 1950s to the early 1960s, followed by a large reduction in stroke mortality rates. Japan had moderate mortality rates for non-communicable diseases, with the exception of stroke, in the 1950s. The improvement in population health continued after the mid-1960s through the implementation of primary and secondary preventive community public health measures for adult mortality from non-communicable diseases and an increased use of advanced medical technologies through the universal insurance scheme. Reduction in health inequalities with improved average population health was partly attributable to equal educational opportunities and financial access to care. With the achievement of success during the health transition since World War 2, Japan now needs to tackle major health challenges that are emanating from a rapidly ageing population, causes that are not amenable to health technologies, and the effects of increasing social disparities to sustain the improvement in population health. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) involves a substantial amount of energy expenditure in humans and, thus, contributes to reducing the risk for obesity. Molecular evolutionary studies have reported that SNPs in/near the uncoupling protein 3 gene (UCP3) and the regulatory associated protein of mTOR complex 1 gene (RPTOR) might influence NST and confer adaptive advantages for modern human dispersal into cold environments. In the present study, the impact of these SNPs on obesity-related traits was investigated. METHODS: Study subjects consisted of 2,834 Japanese adults (percentage of female: 46{\%}, mean age: 51.5). Associations of the UCP3-55C/T and the RPTOR-26934C/T - the 2 potential genetic variations involved in cold adaptation and thermogenic mechanisms in mammals, with quantitative obesity-related traits including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, visceral fat area (VFA), VFA adjusted for BMI, and selected blood parameters - were tested using multiple linear regression models. Sliding windowsampling analysis was applied to depict seasonal effects of the SNPs on the obesity-related phenotypes. RESULTS: UCP3-55C/T and the RPTOR-26934C/T did not show any association with obesity traits and blood chemical parameters in multiple linear regression models consisting of the whole subjects. Moreover, sliding window sampling-based association analyses involving seasonality also failed to find associations between these two SNPs and obesity-related traits. CONCLUSIONS: UCP3-55C/T and the RPTOR-26934C/T may only have subtle effects on the development of obesity-related traits in the present humans. These two SNPs might be irrelevant to inter-individual variations in energy metabolism and efficiency of NST.},

abstract = {This study examines the influence of circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and serum leptin on bone mass as well as modulation of bone mass during skeletal development. Moreover, an inverse relationship between IGF-1 and leptin is reported. To evaluate the effects of serum IGF-1 and serum leptin on bone mass in healthy postmenopausal women, and the possible role of IGF-1 in leptin production, we studied a population of 123 women, aged 39-82 years. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by whole-body dual-energy X ray absorptiometry, which also enables measurement of body composition. Bone metabolism was assessed by measuring serum total alkaline phosphatase (TAP) and urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine (HP/Cr) excretion. IGF-1 correlated significantly with age (r = -0.28, p {\textless} 0.01) and years since menopause (r = -0.24, p {\textless} 0.01). A negative correlation was also found with weight and body mass index (r = -0.15, p {\textless} 0.05 and r = -0.19, p {\textless} 0.05, respectively). Leptin values were strongly correlated with weight (r = 0.7, p {\textless} 0.01), BMI (r = 0.7, p {\textless} 0.01), fat mass (r = 0.77, p {\textless} 0.01), and lean mass (r = 0.39, p {\textless} 0.01); a significant correlation was found with total body BMD (r = 0.29, p {\textless} 0.01), TAP (r = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.05), and HP/Cr (r = 0.18, p {\textless} 0.05). After adjustment for BMI, the significance of these relationships disappeared, demonstrating the lack of effect of serum leptin on BMD and bone turnover independent of body weight. On the other hand, the relationship between BMD and fat mass remained statistically significant after adjusting for serum leptin (r = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.05). Controlling for BMI eliminated the significant inverse correlation between IGF-1 and leptin; significant differences in leptin levels were found among women in the lower and higher quartile of IGF-1, suggesting that leptin production may be inhibited only at high values of serum IGF-1. We conclude that serum IGF-1 and serum leptin have no direct effect on bone mass and bone turnover.},

abstract = {Abstract: Alpha linolenic acid-enriched diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG) reduces visceral fat area and body fat in rodents and humans compared to conventional triacylglycerol (TAG). Although ALA-DAG increases dietary fat utilization as energy in rodents, its effects in humans are not known. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover intervention trial performed to clarify the effect of ALA-DAG on postprandial energy metabolism in humans. Nineteen healthy subjects participated in this study, and postprandial energy metabolism was evaluated using indirect calorimetry followed by 14-d repeated pre-consumption of TAG (rapeseed oil) as a control or ALA-DAG. As a primary outcome, ALA- DAG induced significantly higher postprandial fat oxidation than TAG. As a secondary outcome, carbohydrate oxidation tended to be decreased. In addition, postprandial energy expenditure was significantly increased by ALA-DAG compared to TAG. These findings suggest that daily ALA-DAG consumption stimulates dietary fat utilization as energy after a meal, as well as greater diet induced thermogenesis in healthy humans. In conclusion, repeated consumption of ALA-DAG enhanced postprandial fat metabolism after a meal, which may partially explain its visceral fat area-reducing effect. Key},

abstract = {A pair of markers, sNAT and vNAT, is derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra (PS) recorded for 5 min with 21 electrodes (4-20 Hz) arranged according to the 10-20 standard. These markers form a new diagnosis tool "NAT" aiming at characterizing various brain disorders. Each signal sequence is divided into segments of 0.64 s and its discrete PS consists of eleven frequency components from 4.68 (3 × 1.56) Hz through 20.34 (13 × 1.56) Hz. PS is normalized to its mean and the bias of PS components on each frequency component across the 21 signal channels is reset to zero. The marker sNAT consists of ten frequency components on 21 channels, characterizing neuronal hyperactivity or hypoactivity as compared with NLc (normal controls). The marker vNAT consists of ten ratios between adjacent PS components denoting the over- or undersynchrony of collective neuronal activities as compared with NLc. The likelihood of a test subject to a specified brain disease is defined in terms of the normalized distance to the template NAT state of the disease in the NAT space. Separation of MCI-AD patients (developing AD in 12-18 months) from NLc is made with a false alarm rate of 15{\%}. Locations with neuronal hypoactivity and undersynchrony of AD patients agree with locations of rCBF reduction measured by SPECT. The 2-D diagram composed of the binary likelihoods between ADc and NLc in the two representations of sNAT and vNAT enables tracing the NAT state of a test subject approaching the AD area, and the follow-up of the treatment effects.},

Here, we measure G adduct levels in humans who daily ingest DAG oil, an edible oil consisting mainly of diacylglycerol. Since DAG oil contains a small amount of glycidol fatty acid esters (GEs), possible exposure to G released from GEs has been raised as a possible concern. For measurement of Hb adducts, we employed the N-alkyl Edman method reported by Landin et al. (1996) using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with minor modifications to detect G-Hb adducts as N-(2,3-dihydroxy-propyl)valine (diHOPrVal). Blood samples were collected from 7 DAG oil users and 6 non-users, and then G-Hb adduct levels were measured. G-Hb adducts were detected in all samples. The average level of diHOPrVal was 3.5 ± 1.9. pmol/g globin in the DAG oil users and 7.1 ± 3.1. pmol/g globin in the non-users. We conclude that there is no increased exposure to G in individuals who daily ingest DAG oil. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model partitions the sources of infection into those from within the household and those from the community at large.

This new model is used to overcome problems associated with the lack of independence of observations in infectious disease data and negative confounding due to the association of unmeasured exposures and immunity. An example of how this new statistical model is used to provide a clearer and less confounded description of risk factor effects is presented for data from influenza A(H3N2) epidemic seasons in the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study. The risk factors examined are age and pre-epidemic season antibody level as measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition test, while the outcome is the infection rate. A standard analysis of the data indicates that the efficacy of protective antibodies is 70{\%} in children and only 47{\%} in adults. However, such an efficacy measurement is negatively confounded by past exposure which is age dependent. By means of the model, the true, unconfounded, efficacy of protective antibodies is shown to be 90{\%} in both adults and children.},

Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the association between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and fracture incidence in older adults. Objective To investigate whether calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements are associated with a lower fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults. Data Sources The PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to December 24, 2016, using the keywordscalcium,vitamin D, andfractureto identify systematic reviews or meta-analyses. The primary randomized clinical trials included in systematic reviews or meta-analyses were identified, and an additional search for recently published randomized trials was performed from July 16, 2012, to July 16, 2017. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials comparing calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment for fracture incidence in community-dwelling adults older than 50 years. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction and assessed study quality. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate risk ratios (RRs), absolute risk differences (ARDs), and 95{\%} CIs using random-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures Hip fracture was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, and total fracture. Results A total of 33 randomized trials involving 51 145 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant association of calcium or vitamin D with risk of hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (calcium: RR, 1.53 [95{\%} CI, 0.97 to 2.42]; ARD, 0.01 [95{\%} CI, 0.00 to 0.01]; vitamin D: RR, 1.21 [95{\%} CI, 0.99 to 1.47]; ARD, 0.00 [95{\%} CI, −0.00 to 0.01]. There was no significant association of combined calcium and vitamin D with hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (RR, 1.09 [95{\%} CI, 0.85 to 1.39]; ARD, 0.00 [95{\%} CI, −0.00 to 0.00]). No significant associations were found between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and the incidence of nonvertebral, vertebral, or total fractures. Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally consistent regardless of the calcium or vitamin D dose, sex, fracture history, dietary calcium intake, and baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, the use of supplements that included calcium, vitamin D, or both compared with placebo or no treatment was not associated with a lower risk of fractures among community-dwelling older adults. These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements in community-dwelling older people.},

The 48-h mean CBT decreased significantly during the 3.5-h sleep condition compared with the 7-h sleep condition (7-h sleep, 36.75 ± 0.11 °C; 3.5-h sleep, 36.68 ± 0.14 °C; p = 0.016). After three consecutive nights of sleep restriction, fasting peptide YY levels and fullness were significantly decreased (p = 0.011), whereas hunger and prospective food consumption were significantly increased, compared to those under the 7-h sleep condition. Shortened sleep increased appetite by decreasing gastric hormone levels, but did not affect EE, suggesting that greater caloric intake during a shortened sleep cycle increases the risk of weight gain.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a technique for determining the electrical conductivity and permittivity distribution inside a medium from measurements made on its surface. The impedance distribution reconstruction in EIT is a nonlinear inverse problem that requires the use of a regularization method. The generalized Tikhonov regularization methods are often used in solving inverse problems. However, for EIT image reconstruction, the generalized Tikhonov regularization methods may lose the boundary information due to its smoothing operation. In this paper, we propose an iterative Lavrentiev regularization and L-curve-based algorithm to reconstruct EIT images. The regularization parameter should be carefully chosen, but it is often heuristically selected in the conventional regularization-based reconstruction algorithms. So, an L-curve-based optimization algorithm is used for selecting the Lavrentiev regularization parameter. Numerical analysis and simulation results are performed to illustrate EIT image reconstruction. It is shown that choosing the appropriate regularization parameter plays an important role in reconstructing EIT images.},

Genome-nutrition divergence describes the misalignment between modern global diets and the genome formed through evolution. A survey of hominin diets over time shows that humans have thrived on a broad range of foods. Earlier diets were highly diverse and nutrient dense, in contrast to modern food systems in which monotonous diets of staple cereals and ultraprocessed foods play a more prominent role. Applying the lens of genome-nutrition divergence to malnutrition reveals shared risk factors for undernutrition and overnutrition at nutrient, food, and environmental levels. Mechanisms for food system shifts, such as crop-neutral agricultural policy, agroecology, and social policy, are explored as a means to realign modern diets with the nutritional patterns to which humans may be better adapted to thrive.},

abstract = {Measurement of visceral fat accumulation is essential for the diagnosis of obesity. Currently, the visceral fat area (VFA) obtained from the abdominal cross-sectional image measured by X-ray CT is used as the gold standard. However it has problems of complexity, cost, and X-ray exposure. On the other hand, the waist circumference is used as a simple index, but it is indirect method and is affected by subcutaneous fat. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a proven method practically used to measure total body fat, and is the most suitable for the measurement of visceral fat accumulation. For the latter purpose, we developed a new simple measurement system using dual current pathways bioelectrical impedance analysis (dual-BIA). This proposed system measures imped ance reflecting the subcutaneous fat volume (SFV) and the fat free volume (FFV) in the abdomen by passing current via respective pathways. Regarding to measure these two imped ance values we adopted the four electrodes method. The VFA was calculated by using these two impedance values and abdominal body shape data to minimize the influence of FFV and SFV. We compared the VFA measured by dual-BIA system with that measured by X-ray CT in 98 subjects, and found a high correlation coefficient (r=0.888, p{\textless}0.001). Our proposed system is suggested to be useful for a simple visceral fat accumulation measurement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND To examine an association between self-reported sleep quality determined by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and metabolic syndrome. METHODS This study was designed as cross-sectional study. Participants were 1481 adults aged 20 years and above from general population (549 males and 932 females). We assessed the global sleep quality by PSQI. PSQI consists of 7 elements, i.e. subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (prolonged sleep onset time), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency (proportion of hours slept to hours spent in bed), sleep disturbance (interruption of sleep), use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction (trouble staying awake while engaging in social activity). Any participants with score of 6 or more are diagnosed to have sleep disorder. We also assessed the above 7 elements, which consisted of a four-grade system (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3). Metabolic syndrome consisted of abdominal obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was done when the participants have abdominal obesity and meet two or more other components. All analyses were adjusted by age, drinking habit, smoking habit, working hours, exercise habit and depression. RESULTS Fifty-two male participants (9.5{\%}) and 133 female (14.3{\%}) scored 6 or more points in global PSQI score. The global PSQI score, sleep latency score and sleep disturbance score of participants with metabolic syndrome were higher level than those without the condition (p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.009, p = 0.025 for male and p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.002 for females, respectively). The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome among participants with PSQI score of 6 or more points were 2.37 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.23-4.58) for males and 2.71 (1.45-5.07) for females in contrast to those with 5 or less points. The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome with sleep latency score of 2 was 2.65 (1.14-6.15) for male and 3.82 (1.81-8.09) for females in contrast with those of 0. The odds ratio of metabolic syndrome with sleep disturbance score of 1 was 1.76 (1.09-2.86) for males and 2.43 (1.26-4.69) for females in contrast with those of 0. CONCLUSIONS Global PSQI score and its components (especially, sleep latency and sleep disturbance) were associated with metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {SUMMARY OBJECTIVE In addition to the waist circumference (WC) measurement, an accurate measurement of visceral fat is very important in terms of the pathology associated with the metabolic syndrome. The only method available for an accurate measurement of a visceral fat area (VFA) is abdominal computed tomography (CT). To overcome this limitation, we estimated VFA using abdominal bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with accuracy comparable to that of abdominal CT, and investigated the relationship between VFA and risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. Because abdominal BIA detects excess visceral fat accumulation that cannot be detected by a measurement of WC, the characteristics of the subjects who were identified as having excessive visceral fat using BIA, but not WC, were examined. METHODS Abdominal BIA was used to estimate VFA in male subjects (n = 1803) (age: 48 ± 10 years, body mass index: 23.9 ± 3.0 kg/m(2)) who provided informed consent. RESULTS The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome diagnosed based on the diagnostic criteria established by the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine was 18{\%}. Among the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, WC was significantly correlated with triglycerides (TG), but estimated VFA was correlated with blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), in addition to TG. Abdominal BIA detected excess visceral fat accumulation in 3{\%} of subjects for whom WC had detected none. Elevated blood pressure, TG, and fasting plasma glucose and decreased HDL-C were also noted in these subjects, and the values of these risk factors were comparable to those of subjects in whom visceral fat accumulation was detected using WC. CONCLUSION Abdominal BIA is a simple and safe method that is superior to WC for the detection of excessive visceral fat accumulation. Therefore, abdominal BIA will likely be used clinically to detect excessive accumulation of visceral fat, which is an important predictor of the metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Despite being a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, obesity has been thought to protect against osteoporosis. However, recent studies have demonstrated a differential impact of specific fat compartments on bone mineral density (BMD) with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) having potential detrimental effects on BMD. Visceral obesity is also associated with dysregulation of the GH/IGF-1 axis, an important regulator of bone homeostasis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the differential effects of abdominal fat depots and muscle, vitamin D, and hormonal determinants, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), testosterone, and estradiol, on trabecular BMD of the lumbar spine. We studied 68 healthy obese premenopausal women (mean BMI, 36.7??4.2kg/m2). Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) was used to assess body composition and lumbar trabecular BMD. There was an inverse association between BMD and VAT, independent of age and BMI (p=0.003). IGF-1 correlated positively with BMD and negatively with VAT and, in stepwise multivariate regression modeling, was the strongest predictor of BMD and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP). Thigh muscle cross sectional area (CSA) and thigh muscle density were also associated with BMD (p{\textless}0.05), but 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], testosterone, free testosterone, and estradiol levels were not. 25(OH)D was associated inversely with BMI, total, and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (p{\textless}0.05). These findings support the hypothesis that VAT exerts detrimental effects, whereas muscle mass exerts positive effects on BMD in premenopausal obese women. Moreover, our findings suggest that IGF-1 may be a mediator of the deleterious effects of VAT on bone health through effects on bone formation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the pattern of the metabolic syndrome in Chinese and the causal relationships among its components, including aging, obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia in these subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, the World Health Organization criteria were used for the diagnosis of glucose intolerance in a population-based study involving 1.513 Chinese subjects in two work sites. Demographic data including age, family history of diabetes, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and sitting blood pressure (BP) were documented. Fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride (TG) and insulin concentrations, and spot urinary albumin concentration (Ualb) were also measured. Structural equation modeling incorporating factor analysis and path analysis was performed to examine the causal relationships among these variables and their interactions. RESULTS Subjects who were treated with antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive drugs or who had a plasma creatinine level {\textgreater} or = 150 mumol/l were excluded (n = 52). The prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were 3.9{\%} (n = 34) and 7.2{\%} (n = 63) in men (n = 881) and 3.1{\%} (n = 18) and 6.7{\%} (n = 39) in women (n = 580), respectively. In both groups, glucose intolerance was associated with increasing age, higher BMI, WHR, BP, Ualb, serum TG, and insulin levels as well as higher prevalence rates of positive family history of diabetes. Structural equation modeling showed that age was a significant determinant for both BMI and WHR. Age and obesity accounted for most of the variance of BP, Ualb, plasma glucose, insulin and TG levels either directly or indirectly. Plasma glucose was determined by a positive family history of diabetes, age, and BMI while TG was dependent on BMI and WHR. Serum insulin was mainly determined by a positive family history of diabetes, obesity, plasma glucose, and TG levels. Apart from age and obesity, BP was also determined by serum insulin, both of which had causal effects on Ualb. CONCLUSIONS This model emphasizes the centrality of aging and obesity as well as a positive family history of diabetes as major determinants of the components of the metabolic syndrome. These components in turn had causal effects upon one another. Apart from a familial tendency, a central neurohormonal mechanism may account for these abnormalities mediated primarily through obesity and in close association with aging.},

From a dataset of 419 cases, including 92 malignancies, 13 features relating to mammographic findings, physical examinations and patients' clinical histories, were extracted to build three Bayesian belief networks. The scenarios tested included a network incorporating all features and two hybrids which combined the outputs of sub-networks corresponding to the image or non-image features. Average areas (Az) under the corresponding ROC curves were used as measures of performance. The network incorporating only image based features performed better (Az =0.81) than that using nonimage features (Az = 0.71). Both hybrid classifiers yielded better performance (Az =0.85 for averaging and Az = 0.87 for logistic regression), but neither hybrid was as accurate as the network incorporating all features (Az = 0.89).

abstract = {Abdominal fat accumulation is considered an essential indicator of human health. Electrical impedance tomography has considerable potential for abdominal fat imaging because of the low specific conductivity of human body fat. In this paper, we propose a robust reconstruction method for high-fidelity conductivity imaging by abstraction of the abdominal cross section using a relatively small number of parameters. Toward this end, we assume homogeneous conductivity in the abdominal subcutaneous fat area and characterize its geometrical shape by parameters defined as the ratio of the distance from the center to boundary of subcutaneous fat to the distance from the center to outer boundary in 64 equiangular directions. To estimate the shape parameters, the sensitivity of the noninvasively measured voltages with respect to the shape parameters is formulated for numerical optimization. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. A 3-dimensional finite element method is used to construct a computer model of the human abdomen. The inverse problems of shape parameters and conductivities are solved concurrently by iterative forward and inverse calculations. As a result, conductivity images are reconstructed with a small systemic error of less than 1{\%} for the estimation of the subcutaneous fat area. A novel method is devised for estimating the boundary of the abdominal subcutaneous fat. The fidelity of the overall reconstructed image to the reference image is significantly improved. The results demonstrate the possibility of realization of an abdominal fat scanner as a low-cost, radiation-free medical device.},

We studied 461 subjects recruited from the health-care center at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine the cross-sectional associations between body composition-related or metabolic parameters and BMD. After adjusting for body weight and other confounders, visceral fat area had an inverse association with BMD in men (beta = -0.133, P = 0.049 for lumbar spine; beta = -0.135, P = 0.037 for femoral neck; beta = -0.179, P = 0.005 for total hip) and women (beta = -0.424, P {\textless} 0.001 for lumbar spine; beta = -0.302, P = 0.005 for femoral neck; beta = -0.274, P = 0.014 for total hip). However, the subcutaneous fat area showed no statistically significant relationship with BMD at most sites. Among the metabolic parameters, HDL cholesterol was positively associated with BMD, while LDL cholesterol was negatively associated with BMD in men. In women, total and LDL cholesterol were negatively associated with BMD at the lumbar spine. We conclude that visceral adiposity is inversely associated with BMD after adjusting for confounders and that metabolic factors may partly contribute to this inverse relation.},

Dietary intake was assessed by using a validated 147-item food-frequency questionnaire. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) scores were derived from the nutrient intake.

abstract = {In bone marrow, osteoblasts and adipocytes are differentiated from mesenchymal progenitor cells and their differentiation is reciprocally regulated by largely unknown mechanisms. In this study, we investigated downstream signaling cascades of adiponectin, a member of the adipocytokine family, in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Adiponectin augmented expression of several osteogenic marker genes and increased osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal progenitor cells. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) was potently increased by adiponectin, whereas inhibition of COX2 activity abolished the effect of adiponectin on osteogenesis. In addition, adiponectin rapidly stimulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase via the adiponectin receptor, AdipoR1, which resulted in c-Jun activation for COX2 expression. Adiponectin also stimulated BMP2 expression in a COX2-dependent manner. Moreover, Runx2, a key osteogenic transcription factor, contributed to the acceleration of osteogenesis in the presence of adiponectin. Collectively, the finding that adiponectin could promote osteogenesis through an intracellular signaling cascade in mesenchymal progenitor cells suggests that adiponectin would be a potential therapeutic target for bone-related diseases.},

Lack of sleep has been identified as a risk factor for obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ingesting CGA over 5 d on energy metabolism and sleep quality in humans. A total of nine healthy subjects (four male and five female) completed a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over intervention study.

abstract = {Background: The thermogenic effects of green tea catechin have been repeatedly reported, but their mechanisms are poorly understood.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic effects of catechin on brown adipose tissue (BAT), a site specialized for nonshivering thermogenesis, in humans.Design: Fifteen healthy male volunteers underwent fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography to assess BAT activity. To examine the acute catechin effect, whole-body energy expenditure (EE) after a single oral ingestion of a beverage containing 615 mg catechin and 77 mg caffeine (catechin beverage) was measured. Next, to investigate the chronic catechin effects, 10 men with low BAT activity were enrolled. Before and after ingestion of the catechin beverage 2 times/d for 5 wk, cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) after 2 h of cold exposure at 19°C, which is proportional to BAT activity, was examined. Both the acute and chronic trials were single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, season-matched crossover studies.Results: A single ingestion of the catechin beverage increased EE in 9 subjects who had metabolically active BAT (mean ± SEM: +15.24 ± 1.48 kcal, P {\textless} 0.01) but not in 6 subjects who had negligible activities (mean ± SEM: +3.42 ± 2.68 kcal). The ingestion of a placebo beverage containing 82 mg caffeine produced a smaller and comparative EE response in the 2 subject groups. Multivariate regression analysis revealed a significant interaction between BAT and catechin on EE ($\beta$ = 0.496, P = 0.003). Daily ingestion of the catechin beverage elevated mean ± SEM CIT (from 92.0 ± 26.5 to 197.9 ± 27.7 kcal/d; P = 0.009), whereas the placebo beverage did not change it.Conclusion: Orally ingested tea catechin with caffeine acutely increases EE associated with increased BAT activity and chronically elevates nonshivering CIT, probably because of the recruitment of BAT, in humans. These trials were registered at www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as UMIN000016361.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of health checkup and the health education "Hokenshido" program based on the concept that visceral fat accumulation causes metabolic syndrome (MetS), leading to cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS AND SUBJECTS Based on the Japanese definition of metabolic syndrome, in the annual health checkup for general subjects, the measurement of waist circumference and use of "Where am I?" chart on the way to develop atherosclerosis were introduced. The study group comprised 3,174 Japanese employees [2,440 males (46±11 years, mean ± SD), 734 females (43±10 years)], who underwent annual health checkup in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The medical staff provided "Hokenshido" for subjects assessed as having MetS and/or at high risk for CVD. RESULTS The prevalence of the MetS in 2003, 2004 and 2005 decreased in males (20.8{\%}, 17.2{\%}, 14.4{\%}, p{\textless}0.001) and females (3.0{\%}, 2.2{\%}, 1.9{\%}, p=0.359), respectively. Among subjects with MetS at baseline, the number of subjects with MetS significantly decreased in males (508, 287, 247, p{\textless}0.0001) and females (22, 8, 6, p{\textless}0.0001), respectively. Mean waist loss was 1.6 cm in males ({\textless}0.0001) and 1.5 cm in females ({\textless}0.001). Among subjects with metabolic syndrome at baseline, the mean waist loss was 2.5 cm in males ({\textless}0.0001) and 3.9 cm in females ({\textless}0.05). Fatal atherosclerotic vascular events were not recorded in this study period. CONCLUSION Health check-up and the "Hokenshido" program reduced the prevalence of the MetS, which might lead to prevention of CVD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The relationship between central obesity and survival in community-dwelling adults with normal body mass index (BMI) is not well-known. OBJECTIVE To examine total and cardiovascular mortality risks associated with central obesity and normal BMI. DESIGN Stratified multistage probability design. SETTING NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). PARTICIPANTS 15,184 adults (52.3{\%} women) aged 18 to 90 years. MEASUREMENTS Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship of obesity patterns defined by BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and total and cardiovascular mortality risk after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS Persons with normal-weight central obesity had the worst long-term survival. For example, a man with a normal BMI (22 kg/m2) and central obesity had greater total mortality risk than one with similar BMI but no central obesity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87 [95{\%} CI, 1.53 to 2.29]), and this man had twice the mortality risk of participants who were overweight or obese according to BMI only (HR, 2.24 [CI, 1.52 to 3.32] and 2.42 [CI, 1.30 to 4.53], respectively). Women with normal-weight central obesity also had a higher mortality risk than those with similar BMI but no central obesity (HR, 1.48 [CI, 1.35 to 1.62]) and those who were obese according to BMI only (HR, 1.32 [CI, 1.15 to 1.51]). Expected survival estimates were consistently lower for those with central obesity when age and BMI were controlled for. LIMITATIONS Body fat distribution was assessed based on anthropometric indicators alone. Information on comorbidities was collected by self-report. CONCLUSION Normal-weight central obesity defined by WHR is associated with higher mortality than BMI-defined obesity, particularly in the absence of central fat distribution.

abstract = {A model is devised for the distribution of the total number of cases in households from a homogeneous community. In the model, community-acquired infection serves as a source of initial infection within households as well as of possible further cases. In addition, infected household members can infect others in the household. Maximum likelihood procedures for the model parameters are given. The model is fitted to symptom data on influenza and the common cold. Influenza seems to spread more easily in the community than within the household, while the opposite may be the case for the common cold. The model, which does not require specification of the time of onset of infection for individuals, can be fitted to serological data; this would provide a more accurate measure of household infection than the symptom data used.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives The increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome necessitates the establishment of tools for evaluating dietary factors associated with visceral fat accumulation and preventing visceral fat obesity. Here, we aimed to develop a dietary factor assessment tool for evaluating visceral fat accumulation. Methods We conducted a dietary habit questionnaire survey and visceral fat measurement by bioelectrical impedance analysis in 11,438 adults (Survey 1) and a dietary habit questionnaire survey and dietary assessment based on 3-day meal records in 579 adults (Survey 2). Dietary habit factors were identified by factor analysis with varimax rotation, and their relationship with visceral fat accumulation and major nutrients were analyzed. Results Factor analysis of the dietary habit questionnaire revealed the following five main dietary factors: "Appetite (15 questions)," "Healthy food choice (5 questions)," "Sedentary behavior (6 questions)," "Calorie restriction (5 questions)," and "Irregular mealtime (4 questions)." "Appetite" correlated positively with visceral fat accumulation and energy intake mainly from carbohydrate. "Healthy food choice" correlated negatively with visceral fat accumulation and positively with the protein/fat ratio, dietary fiber/carbohydrate ratio, and N-3 fatty acid/fat ratio. Dietary guidance to modify excess energy intake and increase nutritional balance might be effective toward preventing visceral fat accumulation. Conclusions The dietary factor assessment tool developed in this study can be used to diagnose problems related to dietary habits and provide guidance for dietary modifications aimed at preventing visceral fat accumulation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To clarify the factors associated with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis, and to present the most recent information available in these areas. PARTICIPANTS From March 27-29, 2000, a nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel was convened, representing the fields of internal medicine, family and community medicine, endocrinology, epidemiology, orthopedic surgery, gerontology, rheumatology, obstetrics and gynecology, preventive medicine, and cell biology. Thirty-two experts from these fields presented data to the panel and an audience of 699. Primary sponsors were the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research. EVIDENCE MEDLINE was searched for January 1995 through December 1999, and a bibliography of 2449 references provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for presentations with relevant literature citations. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience. CONSENSUS PROCESS The panel, answering predefined questions, developed conclusions based on evidence presented in open forum and the literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read and circulated to the experts and the audience for public discussion. The panel resolved conflicts and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The draft statement was posted on the Web on March 30, 2000, and updated with the panel's final revisions within a few weeks. CONCLUSIONS Though prevalent in white postmenopausal women, osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages and has significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. Risks for osteoporosis (reflected by low bone mineral density [BMD]) and for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important but poorly validated role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing fracture risk, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation with these 2 nutrients may be necessary in persons not achieving recommended dietary intake. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce risk of falls in older persons. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary treatment goal for patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, including those that enhance bone mass and reduce the risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.},

abstract = {In total hip arthroplasty (THA), short stemmed cementless implants are used because they are thought to stimulate physiological bone remodeling and reduce stress shielding. We performed a numerical investigation on bone remodeling after implantation of a specific short stemmed implant using finite element analysis (FEA). Overall bone mass loss was 2.8{\%} in the entire femur. Bone mass decrease was mostly found in the proximal part of the calcar and in the greater trochanter due to the vast cross section of the implant, probably leading to stress shielding. In the diaphysis, no change in the apparent bone density was proven. The assumptions made agreed well with bone remodeling data from THA recipients who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. However, the clinical investigation revealed a bone mass increase in the minor trochanter region that was less pronounced in the FEA. Further comparisons to other stem designs must be done to verify if the relative advantages of the investigated implant can be accepted.},

abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is gaining popularity as a focal ablation modality for the treatment of unresectable tumors. One clinical limitation of IRE is the absence of methods for real-time treatment evaluation, namely actively monitoring the dimensions of the induced lesion. This information is critical to ensure a complete treatment and minimize collateral damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nGOAL: In this study we are taking advantage of the biophysical properties of living tissues to address this critical demand.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using advanced microfabrication techniques, we have developed an electrical impedance micro-sensor to collect impedance data along the length of a bipolar IRE probe for treatment verification. For probe characterization and interpretation of the readings we used potato tuber, which is a suitable platform for IRE experiments without having the complexities of in vivo or ex vivo models. We used the impedance spectra, along with an electrical model of the tissue, to obtain critical parameters such as the conductivity of the tissue before, during, and after completion of treatment. To validate our results, we used a finite element model to simulate the electric field distribution during treatments in each potato.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: It is shown that electrical impedance spectroscopy could be used as a technique for treatment verification, and when combined with appropriate FEM modeling can determine the lesion dimensions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This technique has the potential to be readily translated for use with other ablation modalities already being used in clinical settings for the treatment of malignancies.},

It is well known, and now well accepted, that increases in exercise and loading of bone are associated with increased bone mass, and that disuse induces osteopenia. However, the mechanisms by which disuse leads to bone loss remain poorly understood, even in the 21st century. Clearly, the skeleton is able to perceive and respond to some general input(s) generated, or lost, as a consequence of mechanical unloading of bone that are distinct from habitual activity, so called functional adaptation. It is the focus of this paper to evaluate the evidence underlying roles for genetics, osteocytes, and interstitial fluid flow in mediating disuse osteopenia.},

A total of 681 individuals volunteered for this study (269 men, 412 women; age: 54.9 ± 14.3; body mass index [BMI]: 23.1 ± 3.3 kg/m2). Lateral lumbar radiographs were evaluated in each intervertebral section (L1/2 to L5/S1) using the Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KL). If at least one intervertebral section was graded as KL 2 or greater, the participants were considered to have LS. The summation of each section of intervertebral section was used as the radiographic severity value of LS. In addition, bone status was evaluated with an osteo-sono assessment index (OSI) at the calcaneus. Serum bone alkaline phosphatase ($\mu$g/mL), N-telopeptide of type I collagen (nMBCE/L), and pentosidine (pmol/mL) concentrations were examined and used as the bone metabolism index. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted with the radiographic severity value of LS as the dependent variable and age, sex, BMI, OSI, and the value of serum bone metabolic markers as the independent variables. The total number of LS participants was 470 (69.0 {\%}); the frequency of LS was higher in men (n = 198) than in women (n = 272; P = 0.036, $\chi$ 2 test). The mean severity value of LS was 7.1 ± 4.4, and the mean value of pentosidine was 120.7 ± 54.8 pmol/mL.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Equol is more biologically active than its precursor daidzein, which is the principal isoflavone found in soybean. There are interindividual differences in the ability to produce equol; these may lead to differences in the effects of isoflavone intervention on human health. This study aimed to investigate whether the effects of soy isoflavones on bone and fat mass are related to an individual's equol status. DESIGN We performed a 1-year double-blind, randomized trial to compare the effects of isoflavone (75 mg of isoflavone conjugates/day) with those of placebo on bone mineral density, fat mass, and serum isoflavone concentrations in early postmenopausal Japanese women who were classified based on their equol-producer phenotype. RESULTS After 1 year, the isoflavone intervention significantly increased the serum equol concentration in the equol producers but not in the nonproducers. In the isoflavone group, the annualized changes in the bone mineral density of the total hip and intertrochanteric regions were -0.46{\%} and -0.04{\%}, respectively, in the equol producers and -2.28{\%} and -2.61{\%}, respectively, in the nonproducers; these values were significantly different (P{\textless}0.05 for both the regions). Significant differences were observed between the equol producers and nonproducers in the isoflavone group with regard to the annualized changes in the fat mass. No significant difference in the annualized changes in bone mineral density and fat mass was observed between the equol producers and nonproducers in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the preventive effects of isoflavones on bone loss and fat accumulation in early postmenopausal women depend on an individual's equol-producing capacity.},

abstract = {Obesity is traditionally viewed to be beneficial to bone health because of well-established positive effect of mechanical loading conferred by body weight on bone formation, despite being a risk factor for many other chronic health disorders. Although body mass has a positive effect on bone formation, whether the mass derived from an obesity condition or excessive fat accumulation is beneficial to bone remains controversial. The underline pathophysiological relationship between obesity and bone is complex and continues to be an active research area. Recent data from epidemiological and animal studies strongly support that fat accumulation is detrimental to bone mass. To our knowledge, obesity possibly affects bone metabolism through several mechanisms. Because both adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from a common multipotential mesenchymal stem cell, obesity may increase adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation while decrease osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation. The increased circulating and tissue proinflammatory cytokines in obesity may promote osteoclast activity and bone resorption through modifying the receptor activator of NF-$\kappa$B (RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin pathway. Furthermore, the excessive secretion of leptin and/or decreased production of adiponectin by adipocytes in obesity may either directly affect bone formation or indirectly affect bone resorption through up-regulated proinflammatory cytokine production. Finally, high-fat intake may interfere with intestinal calcium absorption and therefore decrease calcium availability for bone formation. Unraveling the relationship between fat and bone metabolism at molecular level may help us to develop therapeutic agents to prevent or treat both obesity and osteoporosis. Obesity, defined as having a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2, is a condition in which excessive body fat accumulates to a degree that adversely affects health. The rates of obesity rates have doubled since 1980 and as of 2007, 33{\%} of men and 35{\%} of women in the US are obese. Obesity is positively associated to many chronic disorders such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers. It is estimated that the direct medical cost associated with obesity in the United States is {\~{}}{\$}100 billion per year.Bone mass and strength decrease during adulthood, especially in women after menopause. These changes can culminate in osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration resulting in increased bone fracture risk. It is estimated that there are about 10 million Americans over the age of 50 who have osteoporosis while another 34 million people are at risk of developing the disease. In 2001, osteoporosis alone accounted for some {\$}17 billion in direct annual healthcare expenditure. Several lines of evidence suggest that obesity and bone metabolism are interrelated. First, both osteoblasts (bone forming cells) and adipocytes (energy storing cells) are derived from a common mesenchymal stem cell and agents inhibiting adipogenesis stimulated osteoblast differentiation and vice versa, those inhibiting osteoblastogenesis increased adipogenesis. Second, decreased bone marrow osteoblastogenesis with aging is usually accompanied with increased marrow adipogenesis. Third, chronic use of steroid hormone, such as glucocorticoid, results in obesity accompanied by rapid bone loss. Fourth, both obesity and osteoporosis are associated with elevated oxidative stress and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. At present, the mechanisms for the effects of obesity on bone metabolism are not well defined and will be the focus of this review.},

abstract = {Aging reduces skeletal muscle mass and strength, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we used mouse models to investigate molecular mechanisms of age-related skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy as well as new potential interventions for these conditions. We identified two small molecules that significantly reduce age-related deficits in skeletal muscle strength, quality, and mass: ursolic acid (a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in apples) and tomatidine (a steroidal alkaloid derived from green tomatoes). Because small molecule inhibitors can sometimes provide mechanistic insight into disease processes, we used ursolic acid and tomatidine to investigate the pathogenesis of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. We found that ursolic acid and tomatidine generate hundreds of small positive and negative changes in mRNA levels in aged skeletal muscle, and the mRNA expression signatures of the two compounds are remarkably similar. Interestingly, a subset of the mRNAs repressed by ursolic acid and tomatidine in aged muscle are positively regulated by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Based on this finding, we investigated ATF4 as a potential mediator of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. We found that a targeted reduction in skeletal muscle ATF4 expression reduces age-related deficits in skeletal muscle strength, quality, and mass, similar to ursolic acid and tomatidine. These results elucidate ATF4 as a critical mediator of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. In addition, these results identify ursolic acid and tomatidine as potential agents and/or lead compounds for reducing ATF4 activity, weakness, and atrophy in aged skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Knowledge of the role that qualitative as opposed to energy aspects of diet play in the accumulation of visceral abdominal adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) is limited and not conclusive. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to evaluate and summarize the existing literature investigating the relationships between qualitative aspects of diet, from single dietary components to overall dietary patterns, and VAT and SAAT. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Observational and controlled intervention studies that assessed healthy adults or adolescents using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or ultrasound were eligible for inclusion. After quality assessment of all eligible studies, 20 observational and 23 controlled intervention studies were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Considering study quality, including nutritional and abdominal adipose tissue assessment, about 30 caloric and noncaloric qualitative aspects of diet were found "to be associated with or affect" VAT and/or SAAT, most notably, medium-chain triacylglycerols, dietary fiber, calcium, phytochemicals, and dietary patterns; for fructose and alcohol, the relationships were less clear. CONCLUSION: Additional well-designed prospective studies are warranted to confirm current findings and to identify further qualitative aspects of diet that may influence VAT and SAAT accumulation.},

abstract = {Context: The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) are well known to be associated with hypertension. However, the extent of the effects is not yet well elucidated in general conditions. Objective: To separately determine the effect of the HPA axis and the RAAS on hypertension in a general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based study of 859 Japanese individuals enrolled in the 2014 Iwaki study and without hypertension or steroid treatment (age, 50.2 = 14.7 years). Main Outcome Measures: Hypertension prevalence, plasma concentration of aldosterone, ACTH, cortisol, and plasma renin activity. Results: Principal component (PC) analysis using these four hormones identified two PCs (PC1 and PC2), which represent levels of these hormones as a whole, and dominance between the HPA axis (ACTH and cortisol) and the RAAS (plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of aldosterone), respectively. Association between these PCs and hypertension was significant (PC1, high vs low, odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.02; and PC2, HPA axis vs RAAS dominancy, OR, 2.08; and 95{\%} CI, 1.51-2.85). However, association between the hormone levels as a whole and hypertension became insignificant after adjustment for multiple factors including these PCs together. However, association between the HPA axis dominance and hypertension remained significant even after the adjustment (the HPA axis vs the RAAS, OR, 1.73; 95{\%} CI, 1.20-2.48). Conclusions: The HPA axis dominance over the RAAS is significantly associated with hypertension in a Japanese population. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the Endocrine Society.},

abstract = {It is desirable to adjust Spearman's rank correlation for covariates, yet existing approaches have limitations. For example, the traditionally defined partial Spearman's correlation does not have a sensible population parameter, and the conditional Spearman's correlation defined with copulas cannot be easily generalized to discrete variables. We define population parameters for both partial and conditional Spearman's correlation through concordance-discordance probabilities. The definitions are natural extensions of Spearman's rank correlation in the presence of covariates and are general for any orderable random variables. We show that they can be neatly expressed using probability-scale residuals (PSRs). This connection allows us to derive simple estimators. Our partial estimator for Spearman's correlation between X and Y adjusted for Z is the correlation of PSRs from models of X on Z and of Y on Z, which is analogous to the partial Pearson's correlation derived as the correlation of observed-minus-expected residuals. Our conditional estimator is the conditional correlation of PSRs. We describe estimation and inference, and highlight the use of semiparametric cumulative probability models, which allow preservation of the rank-based nature of Spearman's correlation. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our estimators and compare them with other popular measures of association, demonstrating their robustness and efficiency. We illustrate our method in two applications, a biomarker study and a large survey.},

The reproduction number, that is, the average number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case, was estimated as a function of time and according to different types of hosts.Results A total of five superspreaders were identified. The reproduction number throughout the course of the outbreak was estimated at 1.0 due to reconstruction of the transmission tree, while the variance of secondary cases generated by a primary case was 52.1. All of the superspreaders involved in this outbreak appeared to have generated a substantial number of contacts in multiple healthcare facilities (association: p{\textless}0.01), generating on average 4.0 (0.0–8.6) and 28.6 (0.0–63.9) secondary cases among patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities and others.

abstract = {Estimation of vaccine efficacy has traditionally focused on the reduction in susceptibility to infection, or the vaccine efficacy for susceptibility (VES). However, a vaccine, such as a prophylactic HIV vaccine, may also lower the infectiousness of a vaccinated person who became infected. The relative reduction in infectiousness due to vaccination is the vaccine efficacy for infectiousness (VEI). Estimation of VEI is challenging because it requires information on exposure to infection, and gathering this type of information is often expensive and difficult, or even impossible. Household studies are expected to provide more information on who is exposed to whom. In a previous paper, we developed a method for estimating VES and VEI from a household study where only the final outbreak data are available. However, the resulting estimates were quite unstable. In this work, we develop a survival model for the estimation of VES and VEI from household data where the time of infection is known for every study participant. Using stochastic simulations, we show that the proposed method significantly reduces the bias and mean square error in the estimation of both VES and VEI as compared to the method based on final outbreak data. We also show that when time-to-event data are available, a household study produces more robust estimators than a same-size study of unrelated individuals. In addition, we investigate the bias in estimating VES and VEI due to misclassification of infection status when only illness data, rather than true infection data, are available.

abstract = {Background {\&} aims: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has been shown to be profoundly responsible of most of the obesity-associated metabolic derangements. The measurement of VAT usually implies the use of imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT). Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of the determination of VAT by means of abdominal bioimpedance (BIA) with the ViScan device in comparison with CT and its clinical usefulness in the management of obesity. Methods: We studied a sample of 140 subjects (73 males/67 females) with BMI ranging from 17.7 to 50.4 kg/m2to evaluate the accuracy of the ViScan in comparison to CT to determine VAT. To further analyze ViScan's clinical usefulness we studied a separate cohort (n = 2849) analyzing cardiometabolic risk factors. Furthermore, we studied the ability of the ViScan to detect changes in VAT after weight gain (n = 107) or weight loss (n = 335). The study was performed from October 2009 through June 2015. Results: ViScan determines VAT with a good accuracy in individuals with a CT-VAT up to 200 cm2, and then with lower precision with increasing body mass, exhibiting a moderate–high correlation with CT-VAT (r = 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001). Importantly, VAT determination with the ViScan exhibits better correlations with several cardiometabolic risk factors such as glucose, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and markers of fatty liver than anthropometric measurements such as BMI or waist circumference. ViScan is able to detect VAT variations after body weight changes. Conclusions: Since the possibility of measuring VAT by imaging techniques is not always available, abdominal BIA represents a good alternative to estimate VAT, allowing the identification of patients with increased VAT-related cardiometabolic risk and a better management of obese patients.

abstract = {Influenza vaccination is recommended as the best way to protect against influenza infection and illness. Due to seasonal changes in influenza virus types and subtypes, a new vaccine must be produced, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) must be estimated, annually. Since 2010, influenza vaccination has been recommended universally in the United States, making randomized clinical trials unethical. Recent studies have used a monitored household cohort study design to determine separate VE estimates against influenza transmission from the household and community. We developed a probability model and accompanying maximum likelihood procedure to estimate vaccine-related protection against transmission of influenza from the household and the community. Using agent-based stochastic simulations, we validated that we can obtain maximum likelihood estimates of transmission parameters and VE close to their true values. Sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of deviations from our assumptions were conducted. We used our method to estimate transmission parameters and VE from data from a monitored household study in Michigan during the 2012-2013 influenza season and were able to detect a significant protective effect of influenza vaccination against community-acquired transmission.},

abstract = {Porphyromonas gingivalis , the keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis, was identified in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Toxic proteases from the bacterium called gingipains were also identified in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, and levels correlated with tau and ubiquitin pathology. Oral P. gingivalis infection in mice resulted in brain colonization and increased production of A$\beta$ 1–42 , a component of amyloid plaques. Further, gingipains were neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro, exerting detrimental effects on tau, a protein needed for normal neuronal function. To block this neurotoxicity, we designed and synthesized small-molecule inhibitors targeting gingipains. Gingipain inhibition reduced the bacterial load of an established P. gingivalis brain infection, blocked A$\beta$ 1–42 production, reduced neuroinflammation, and rescued neurons in the hippocampus. These data suggest that gingipain inhibitors could be valuable for treating P. gingivalis brain colonization and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Optimal acquisition of bone mass in puberty is a key determinant of the lifetime risk of osteoporosis and has a strong genetic basis. We investigated the relationship between the COL1A1 Sp1 polymorphism and BMD in early puberty, and how the genotypes relate to bone size and geometry as well as bone turnover and material properties in 247 10- to 13-year-old girls. Bone properties were measured using DXA, pQCT, and ultrasound. Also, serum P1NP, OC, B-ALP, and TRACP 5b were assessed. Our results showed that girls with the TT genotype had significantly lower BMC and BMD of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur, as well as BUA at the calcaneus, than those with the GT and GG genotype. They also had significantly lower B-ALP, as well as P1NP/TRACP 5b and (OC + B-ALP)/TRACP 5b, compared to the others. These findings indicate that the COL1A1 polymorphism is associated with low bone properties in early puberty and suggest a possible physiological effect on collagen metabolism and bone turnover. This information may contribute to the identification of children at risk for suboptimal acquisition of peak bone mass and may ultimately be of value in the planning of early preventive strategies for osteoporosis.},

abstract = {We assessed the relationship of the dietary glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and intake of carbohydrate and rice, and risk of mortality from stroke and its subtypes. The cohort consisted of 12561 men and 15 301 women residing in Takayama, Japan, in 1992. At the baseline, a food frequency questionnaire was administered; and the dietary GI, GL, and intake of carbohydrates and rice were estimated. Deaths from stroke occurring in the cohort were prospectively noted until 1999 with data from the office of the National Vital Statistics. The risk of mortality from stroke was assessed with a Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age; body mass index; smoking status; physical activity; history of hypertension; education; and intake of total energy, alcohol, dietary fiber, salt, and total fat. The risk of stroke subtypes was assessed in the age-adjusted model. The hazard ratios of total stroke comparing the highest vs the lowest quartiles of the dietary GI were 0.78 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.41-1.47) with Ptrend = .50 in men and 2.09 (95{\%} CI, 1.01-4.31) with Ptrend = .10 in women. Among women, the association was also significant with the risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio = 2.45; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-5.92; Ptrend = .03); and a significant positive trend was also observed between dietary GL and mortality from hemorrhagic stroke (Ptrend = .05). The current study implies that diets with a high dietary GI increase the risk of mortality from stroke among Japanese women. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Energy homeostasis is maintained locally through parenchymal-stromal cell interaction and systemically through metabolic organ network. In obese adipose tissue, saturated fatty acids, which are released as a danger signal from hypertrophied adipocytes, stimulates a pathogen sensor TLR4 in the infiltrating macrophages, thus establishing a vicious cycle between adipocytes and macrophages to stimulate adipose tissue inflammation. Histologically, macrophages aggregate to constitute crown-like structures (CLS), where they are thought to scavenge the residual lipid droplets of dead adipocytes. Free fatty acids, when released from obese visceral fat depots, are transported in large quantities to the liver via the portal vein, where they are accumulated as ectopic fat, thus developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is a unique histological feature termed÷hepatic CLS (hCLS){\o}in the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver, where macrophages aggregate to surround dead hepatocytes with large lipid droplets. Notably, the number of hCLS is positively correlated with the extent of liver fibrosis. Our data suggest that hCLS serves as an origin of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis during the progression from simple steatosis to NASH. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, an oral antidiabetic drug, promotes the urinaryexcretion of glucose by blocking its reabsorption in renal proximal tubules. Inhibition of SGLT2 lowers is expected to reduce body weight because of urinary calorie loss. Interestingly, SGLT2 inhibition improves hepatic steatosis in obese mice irrespective of body weight reduction. There is an inverse correlation between liver weight and adipose tissue weight in obese mice with SGLT2 inhibition, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibition induces the÷healthy{\o}adipose tissue expansion and prevents ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. Our data suggest that seeing both the wood and trees is Required to understand the molecular mechanism of lifestyle-related diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The purposes of this study were to reveal the prevalence of locomotive syndrome (LS) evaluated by loco-check in the Japanese general population and to analyze the relationship between radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA) and lumbar spondylosis, metabolic syndrome and LS. Furthermore, we evaluated LS according to functional examinations. METHODS Seven hundred twenty-two volunteers aged 56.6 ± 13.6 years participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in 2010 and were classified into two groups: LS (one or more disabilities) or non-LS (no disability) according to the criteria of LS proposed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Radiographic knee OA and lumbar spondylosis were defined according to the Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of two or more risk factors in addition to visceral obesity. The prevalence of LS associated with knee OA, lumbar spondylosis and metabolic syndrome was compared statistically. Also, data of six functional examinations were compared between the non-LS and LS groups. RESULTS The prevalence of LS was 21.2 {\%} in males and 35.6 {\%} in females and increased with aging regardless of gender. The prevalence of LS with knee OA was 48.7 {\%}, with lumbar spondylosis was 33.8 {\%}, and with metabolic syndrome was 43.4 {\%}. The non-LS group had significantly better performance in the functional reach and sit and reach tests than the LS group in males and females by age-adjusted comparison. CONCLUSION The prevalence of LS in the general population was higher in females than in males. A strong risk factor for LS was radiographic knee OA. Also, those with LS had loss of skeletal muscle mass, balancing and flexibility. This study showed that evaluation by loco-check was an acceptable tool to detect the early stage of locomotive disability for LS, and interventional prevention for strength, balancing and flexibility would be helpful for those with LS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evidence is sparse and contradictory regarding the association between low-carbohydrate diet score and type 2 diabetes risk, and no prospective study examined the association among Asians, who consume greater amount of carbohydrate. We prospectively investigated the association of low-carbohydrate diet score with type 2 diabetes risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Participants were 27,799 men and 36,875 women aged 45-75 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study and who had no history of diabetes. Dietary intake was ascertained by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and low-carbohydrate diet score was calculated from total carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake. The scores for high animal protein and fat or for high plant protein and fat were also calculated. Odds ratios of self-reported, physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over 5-year were estimated by using logistic regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the 5-year period, 1191 new cases of type 2 diabetes were self-reported. Low-carbohydrate diet score for high total protein and fat was significantly associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in women (P for trend {\textless}0.001); the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of type 2 diabetes for the highest quintile of the score were 0.63 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.46-0.84), compared with those for the lowest quintile. Additional adjustment for dietary glycemic load attenuated the association (odds ratio 0.75, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.45-1.25). When the score separated for animal and for plant protein and fat, the score for high animal protein and fat was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in women, whereas the score for high plant protein and fat was not associated in both men and women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Low-carbohydrate diet was associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in Japanese women and this association may be partly attributable to high intake of white rice. The association for animal-based and plant-based low-carbohydrate diet warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants to determine whether an observational association between a risk factor and an outcome is consistent with a causal effect.1 Mendelian randomization relies on the natural, random assortment of genetic variants during meiosis yielding a random distribution of genetic variants in a population.1 Individuals are naturally assigned at birth to inherit a genetic variant that affects a risk factor (eg, a gene variant that raises low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol levels) or not inherit such a variant. Individuals who carry the variant and those who do not are then followed up for the development of an outcome of interest. Because these genetic variants are typically unassociated with confounders, differences in the outcome between those who carry the variant and those who do not can be attributed to the difference in the risk factor. For example, a genetic variant associated with higher LDL cholesterol levels that also is associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease would provide supportive evidence for a causal effect of LDL cholesterol on coronary heart disease.},

abstract = {Background High plasma HDL cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction, but whether this association is causal is unclear. Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodified by disease processes, mendelian random isation can be used to test the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal. Methods We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) and tested this SNP in 20 studies (20 913 myocardial infarction cases, 95 407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that exclusively associate with HDL cholesterol and tested this score in up to 12 482 cases of myocardial infarction and 41 331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol. Findings Carriers of the LIPG 396Ser allele (2{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} frequency) had higher HDL cholesterol (0{\textperiodcentered}14 mmol/L higher p=8×10-13) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with noncarriers. This difference in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13{\%} (odds ratio [OR] 0{\textperiodcentered}87, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}84-0{\textperiodcentered}91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}88-1{\textperiodcentered}11, p=0{\textperiodcentered}85). From observational epidemiology, an increase of 1 SD in HDL cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}62, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}58-0{\textperiodcentered}66). However, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}93 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}68-1{\textperiodcentered}26, p=0{\textperiodcentered}63). For LDL cholesterol, the estimate from observational epidemiology (a 1 SD increase in LDL cholesterol associated with OR 1{\textperiodcentered}54, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}45-1{\textperiodcentered}63) was concordant with that from genetic score (OR 2{\textperiodcentered}13 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}69-2{\textperiodcentered}69, p=2×10-10). Interpretation Some genetic mechanisms that raise plasma HDL cholesterol do not seem to lower risk of myocardial infarction. These data challenge the concept that raising of plasma HDL cholesterol will uniformly translate into reductions in risk of myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {Various bootstraps have been proposed for bootstrapping clustered data from one-way arrays. The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether polymorphisms G1704T and G82S of the rage gene were related to diabetic retinopathy, we performed a case-control study in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes were examined for polymorphisms G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene. The genotypes of G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene were determined with a fluorescent allele-specific DNA primer assay system. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was diagnosed in a masked manner by independent ophthalmologists using fundus photographs and was classified as non-diabetic retinopathy (NDR), non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative retinopathy (PDR). RESULTS: The T allele frequency of G1704T and S allele frequency of G82S in patients with DR did not significantly differ from those without retinopathy. There were no differences among the genotypes of G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene regarding age, duration of diabetes, BMI, HbA(1c), blood pressure, and lipids levels. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that polymorphisms G1704T and G82S of the RAGE gene are not related to DR in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of a vaccination strategy to control transmission of an infectious disease depends on the way vaccine doses are distributed to individuals in a community of households. Here we show that this dependence is more complicated when acquisition and severity of illness are determined by the size of the infecting dose, as is thought to be the case for measles and varicella. Two alternative formulations for the way vaccination changes an individual's susceptibility and infectivity show that vaccination coverage, the nature of the vaccine response and the distribution of household size also have a big impact on which strategy is more effective. These judgements are made by comparing the post-vaccination reproduction numbers corresponding to different vaccination strategies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nutrition is an important "modifiable" factor in the development and maintenance of bone mass and in the prevention of osteoporosis. The improvement of calcium intake in prepuberal age translates to gain in bone mass and, with genetic factor, to achievement of Peak Bone Mass (PBM), the higher level of bone mass reached at the completion of physiological growth. Individuals with higher PBM achieved in early adulthood will be at lower risk for developing osteoporosis later in life. Achieved the PBM, it is important maintain the bone mass gained and reduce the loss. This is possible adopting a correct behaviour eating associated to regular physical activity and correct life style. The diet is nutritionally balanced with caloric intake adequate to requirement of individual. This is moderate in protein (1 g/kg/die), normal in fat and the carbohydrates provide 55-60{\%} of the caloric intake. A moderate intake of proteins is associated with normal calcium metabolism and presumably does'nt alter bone turnover. An adequate intake of alkali-rich foods may help promote a favorable effect of dietary protein on the skeleton. Lactose intolerance may determinate calcium malabsorption or may decrease calcium intake by elimination of milk and dairy products. Omega3 fatty acids may "down-regulate" pro-inflammatory cytokines and protect against bone loss by decreasing osteoclast activation and bone reabsorption. The diet is characterized by food containing high amount of calcium, potassium, magnesium and low amount of sodium. If it is impossible to reach the requirement with only diet, it is need the supplement of calcium and vitamin D. Other vitamins (Vit. A, C, E, K) and mineral (phosphorus, fluoride, iron, zinc, copper and boron) are required for normal bone metabolism, thus it is need adequate intake of these dietary components. It is advisable reduce ethanol, caffeine, fibers, phytic and ossalic acid intake. The efficacy of phytoestrogens is actually under investigation. Some drugs may interfere with calcium and other nutrients and produce an unfavourable effect on bone health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Facemasks and respirators have been stockpiled during pandemic preparedness. However, data on their effectiveness for limiting transmission are scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness of facemask use by index cases for limiting influenza transmission by large droplets produced during coughing in households. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A cluster randomized intervention trial was conducted in France during the 2008-2009 influenza season. Households were recruited during a medical visit of a household member with a positive rapid influenza A test and symptoms lasting less than 48 hours. Households were randomized either to the mask or control group for 7 days. In the intervention arm, the index case had to wear a surgical mask from the medical visit and for a period of 5 days. The trial was initially intended to include 372 households but was prematurely interrupted after the inclusion of 105 households (306 contacts) following the advice of an independent steering committee. We used generalized estimating equations to test the association between the intervention and the proportion of household contacts who developed an influenza-like illness during the 7 days following the inclusion. Influenza-like illness was reported in 24/148 (16.2{\%}) of the contacts in the intervention arm and in 25/158 (15.8{\%}) of the contacts in the control arm and the difference between arms was 0.40{\%} (95{\%}CI: -10{\%} to 11{\%}, P = 1.00). We observed a good adherence to the intervention. In various sensitivity analyses, we did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks. CONCLUSION This study should be interpreted with caution since the lack of statistical power prevents us to draw formal conclusion regarding effectiveness of facemasks in the context of a seasonal epidemic.

The serum beta-carotene increased gradually (597 - 830{\%} increase) during the study, whereas the serum ascorbic acid reached nearly a steady-state at the one-month point and remained stable thereafter (88 - 95{\%} increase). No statistically significant interaction between beta-carotene and vitamin C supplementations was observed either for serum beta-carotene or for serum ascorbic acid.

The model is next assessed through two examples.

Then, a more realistic prob- lem is solved using those parameters, with a mesh of the Oxford ventricular rabbit model.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to provide a framework for the analysis of visceral obesity and its determinants in women, where complex inter-relationships are observed among lifestyle, nutritional and metabolic predictors. Thirty-four predictors related to lifestyle, adiposity, body fat distribution, blood lipids and adipocyte sizes have been considered as potential correlates of visceral obesity in women. To properly address the difficulties in managing such interactions given our limited sample of 150 women, bootstrapped Bayesian networks were constructed based on novel constraint-based learning methods that appeared recently in the statistical learning community. Statistical significance of edge strengths was evaluated and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network robustness. To allow accessible interpretation and integrate biological knowledge into the final network, several undirected edges were afterwards directed with physiological expertise according to relevant literature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Extensive experiments on synthetic data sampled from a known Bayesian network show that the algorithm, called Recursive Hybrid Parents and Children (RHPC), outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that appeared in the recent literature. Regarding biological plausibility, we found that the inference results obtained with the proposed method were in excellent agreement with biological knowledge. For example, these analyses indicated that visceral adipose tissue accumulation is strongly related to blood lipid alterations independent of overall obesity level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Bayesian Networks are a useful tool for investigating and summarizing evidence when complex relationships exist among predictors, in particular, as in the case of multifactorial conditions like visceral obesity, when there is a concurrent incidence for several variables, interacting in a complex manner.

abstract = {Objective This study was designed to evaluate the effects of equol and resveratrol supplementation on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in otherwise healthy menopausal women with hot flashes, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Methods Sixty recently menopausal women aged 50–55 years were randomized in a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial to receive 200 mg of fermented soy containing 10 mg of equol and 25 mg of resveratrol (1 tablet/day). The primary outcome was the change in score on the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), used to evaluate the severity of age-/menopause-related complaints. Additional outcome measures included the subject-reported score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), which was used specifically to assess sleep quality. Results The symptoms assessed by the MRS improved during treatment in the active group. Comparison between placebo and treatment groups revealed statistically significant improvement in particular for dryness of vagina (−85.7{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.001), heart discomfort (−78.8{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001) and sexual problems (−73.3{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). On the HAM-D significant improvements at week 12 were seen in work and activities (−94.1{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.001). Subjects treated with equol and resveratrol also had significant differences in the sleep domain of the NHP (p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion These findings provide evidence that 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with equol and resveratrol may improve menopause-related quality of life in healthy women.},

Serum sOB-R concentrations were lower in the female subjects compared with the males (27.24 +/- 29.06 vs. 50.14 +/- 39.74 ng/ml, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas leptin, adiponectin, and resistin concentrations were significantly higher in females (leptin: 9.93 +/- 6.01 vs. 3.27 +/- 2.54 ng/ml, P {\textless} 0.001; adiponectin: 11.40 +/- 6.73 micro g/ml vs. 4.90 +/- 2.79 micro g/ml; P {\textless} 0.001; resistin: 16.86 +/- 5.39 ng/ml in females vs. 14.00 +/- 7.16 ng/ml in males, P {\textless} 0.02). Simple regression analysis showed that, in both genders, leptin, free leptin index, adiponectin, and resistin correlated positively with body fat mass and negatively with waist to hip ratio. sOB-R correlated negatively with body fat mass and positively with waist to hip ratio. Multiple regression analysis models controlling for gender, body fat, and total energy intake demonstrated that sOB-R is positively associated with energy intake from carbohydrates and negatively with energy intake from dietary fat, whereas free leptin index is negatively associated with energy intake from carbohydrates and positively with energy intake from dietary fat. No statistically significant correlations were observed between serum adiponectin or resistin concentrations and total energy or macronutrient intake. Thus, total energy intake and macronutrient composition of the diet are associated with sOB-R and free leptin index but do not play a role of comparable significance in predicting adiponectin and resistin concentrations in healthy young subjects.},

abstract = {Results Approximately 32{\%} fewer neonates who received the moisturizer had AD/eczema by week 32 than control subjects (P =.012, log-rank test). We did not show a statistically significant effect of emollient on allergic sensitization based on the level of IgE antibody against egg white at 0.34 kU A /L CAP-FEIA equivalents. However, the sensitization rate was significantly higher in infants who had AD/eczema than in those who did not (odds ratio, 2.86; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-6.73). Conclusion Daily application of moisturizer during the first 32 weeks of life reduces the risk of AD/eczema in infants. Allergic sensitization during this time period is associated with the presence of eczematous skin but not with moisturizer use.
Background Recent studies have suggested that epidermal barrier dysfunction contributes to the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) and other allergic diseases. Objective We performed a prospective, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether protecting the skin barrier with a moisturizer during the neonatal period prevents development of AD and allergic sensitization.
Methods An emulsion-type moisturizer was applied daily during the first 32 weeks of life to 59 of 118 neonates at high risk for AD (based on having a parent or sibling with AD) who were enrolled in this study. The onset of AD (eczematous symptoms lasting {\textgreater}4 weeks) and eczema (lasting {\textgreater}2 weeks) was assessed by a dermatology specialist on the basis of the modified Hanifin and Rajka criteria. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of AD plus eczema (AD/eczema) at week 32 of life. A secondary outcome, allergic sensitization, was evaluated based on serum levels of allergen-specific IgE determined by using a high-sensitivity allergen microarray of diamond-like carbon-coated chips.},

abstract = {Study Design.A clinical study on osteoporotic vertebral strength in daily living using a computed tomography (CT)-based nonlinear finite element (FE) model.
Objective.To evaluate the differences in predicted fracture strength of osteoporotic vertebral bodies among the different loading conditions that are occurring in the activities of daily living.
Summary of Background Data.FE model has been reported to predict vertebral strength in uniaxial loading, but forward bending load plays an important role in osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
Methods.Strengths of the second lumbar vertebra in 41 female patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis were analyzed using a nonlinear CT-based FE method. Three different loading conditions were adopted uniaxial compression, forward bending, and erect standing. The same boundary condition was used for all loading conditions. Predicted strengths under forward bending and erect standing were compared with that under uniaxial compression and differences in strength were statistically analyzed.
Results.The regression equation relating strength under uniaxial compression to that under erect standing was expressed as y = 0.8912x + 19.332 (R = 0.9522), whereas the equation relating uniaxial compression to forward bending was y = 0.7033x + 55.071 (R = 0.8342). Both relationships were significant, but the correlation between forward bending and uniaxial compression was not strong, while strength was lower under forward bending than under uniaxial compression according to the Friedman multiple comparison test (P = 0.00017).
Conclusion.Strength under forward bending correlated significantly to that under uniaxial compression, but the correlation was not strong. Therefore, in osteoporotic patients, both uniaxial compression and forward bending should be assessed to evaluate fracture risk in daily living using a CT-based FE method.},

abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for a plethora of severe morbidities and premature death. Most supporting evidence comes from observational studies that are prone to chance, bias and confounding. Even data on the protective effects of weight loss from randomized controlled trials will be susceptible to confounding and bias if treatment assignment cannot be masked, which is usually the case with lifestyle and surgical interventions. Thus, whilst obesity is widely considered the major modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases, its causes and consequences are often difficult to determine. Addressing this is important, as the prevention and treatment of any disease requires that interventions focus on causal risk factors. Disease prediction, although not dependent on knowing the causes, is nevertheless enhanced by such knowledge. Here, we provide an overview of some of the barriers to causal inference in obesity research and discuss analytical approaches, such as Mendelian randomization, that can help to overcome these obstacles. In a systematic review of the literature in this field, we found: (i) probable causal relationships between adiposity and bone health/disease, cancers (colorectal, lung and kidney cancers), cardiometabolic traits (blood pressure, fasting insulin, inflammatory markers and lipids), uric acid concentrations, coronary heart disease and venous thrombosis (in the presence of pulmonary embolism), (ii) possible causal relationships between adiposity and gray matter volume, depression and common mental disorders, oesophageal cancer, macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease, diabetic kidney disease, nuclear cataract and gall stone disease, and (iii) no evidence for causal relationships between adiposity and Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer, venous thrombosis (in the absence of pulmonary embolism), liver function and periodontitis.},

abstract = {AIM: Although previous studies have shown that consumption of green tea catechins (GTC) and walking might prevent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the effects of GTC supplementation on CVD risk in active older people are unknown. METHODS: A total of 52 older adults (male/female 20/32, mean age 69.1 ± 5.9 years) participating in a pedometer-based walking program were randomly assigned to a GTC group with an intake of 630.9 mg GTC daily (n=26) or a control group (n=26) for 14 weeks. Cardiovascular risk markers were measured before and after this trial. RESULTS: In the GTC group, values of the following markers were significantly reduced (P{\textless}0.05) from the beginning to the end of the trial: waist circumference (from 84.2 ± 8.4 to 82.2 ± 8.5 cm), hip circumference (from 95.1 ± 6.9 to 92.2 ± 6.3 cm), total cholesterol (from 233.0 ± 46.3 to 218.8 ± 42.3 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 130.4 ± 36.2 to 119.1 ± 33.4 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (from 2.0 ± 1.7 to 1.7 ± 0.5); only hip circumference (from 95.6 ± 8.1 to 94.1 ± 7.6 cm) was significantly reduced (P{\textless}0.05) in the control group. No significant between-group differences were found for any parameter measured. CONCLUSIONS: Although GTC might reduce cholesterol levels, the present randomized control trial suggests that GTC supplementation in active older participants did not significantly affect cardiovascular risk markers. Future studies should identify more effective combinations of GTC supplementation and physical activity.},

Information about the association between diet and adipose tissue is scarce. This study aimed to identify food group intake associated with VAT and SAAT and the VAT:SAAT ratio in a Northern German population. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 344 men and 241 women who underwent an MRI to quantify total volumes of VAT and SAAT. Intake of fourteen food groups was assessed with a self-administered 112-item FFQ. Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, energy intake, physical activity, intake of other food groups and mutual adjustment for VAT and SAAT were calculated to analyse the associations between standardised food group intake and VAT and SAAT, or the VAT:SAAT ratio. Intakes of potatoes ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}P{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} =0{\textperiodcentered}043) and cakes ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}P{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} =0{\textperiodcentered}003) were positively and inversely, respectively, associated with both VAT and SAAT.

abstract = {A maximum likelihood procedure is given for estimating household and community transmission parameters from observed influenza infection data. The estimator for the household transmission probability is an improvement over the classical secondary attack rate calculations because it factors out community-acquired infections from true secondary infections. The mathematical model used does not require the specification of infection onset times and, therefore, can be used with serologic data which detect asymptomatic infections. Infection data were derived by serology and virus isolation from the Tecumseh Respiratory Illness Study and the Seattle Flu Study for the years 1975-1979. Included were seasons of influenza B and influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. The transmission characteristics of influenza B and influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) outbreaks during this period are compared. Influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and influenza B are found to be in descending order both in terms of ease of spread in the household and intensity of the epidemic in the community. Children are found to be the main introducers of influenza into households. the degree of estimation error from the misclassification of infected and susceptible individuals is illustrated with a stochastic simulation model. This model simulates the expected number of detected infections at different levels of sensitivity and specificity for the serologic tests used. Other sources of estimation error, such as deviation from the model assumption of uniform community exposure and the possible presence of superspreaders, are also discussed.},

Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. The present study was conducted from May 1 to July 11, 2016.Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes were determined at assessment, based on self-report. Blood pressure was measured clinically. Participants self-reported sociodemographic information pertaining to relevant confounders. A polygenic risk score comprising 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies was constructed, and the genetic risk score was applied to derive causal estimates using a mendelian randomization approach.Results Of the 119 859 individuals included in the study, 56 816 (47.4{\%}) were men; mean (SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years. Mendelian randomization analysis showed significant positive associations between genetically instrumented higher BMI and risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] per 1-SD higher BMI, 1.64; 95{\%} CI, 1.48-1.83; P = 1.1 × 10−19), coronary heart disease (OR, 1.35; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .007) and type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.53; 95{\%} CI, 2.04-3.13; P = 1.5 × 10−17), as well as systolic blood pressure ($\beta$ = 1.65 mm Hg; 95{\%} CI, 0.78-2.52 mm Hg; P = 2.0 × 10−04) and diastolic blood pressure ($\beta$ = 1.37 mm Hg; 95{\%} CI, 0.88-1.85 mm Hg; P = 3.6 × 10−08). These associations were independent of age, sex, Townsend deprivation scores, alcohol intake, and smoking history.Conclusions and Relevance The results of this study add to the burgeoning evidence of an association between higher BMI and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. This finding has relevance for public health policies in many countries with increasing obesity levels.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A controlled 3-way crossover design involving 21 overweight and obese young adults conducted at Children's Hospital Boston and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, between June 16, 2006, and June 21, 2010, with recruitment by newspaper advertisements and postings. INTERVENTION After achieving 10{\%} to 15{\%} weight loss while consuming a run-in diet, participants consumed an isocaloric low-fat diet (60{\%} of energy from carbohydrate, 20{\%} from fat, 20{\%} from protein; high glycemic load), low-glycemic index diet (40{\%} from carbohydrate, 40{\%} from fat, and 20{\%} from protein; moderate glycemic load), and very low-carbohydrate diet (10{\%} from carbohydrate, 60{\%} from fat, and 30{\%} from protein; low glycemic load) in random order, each for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was resting energy expenditure (REE), with secondary outcomes of total energy expenditure (TEE), hormone levels, and metabolic syndrome components. RESULTS Compared with the pre-weight-loss baseline, the decrease in REE was greatest with the low-fat diet (mean [95{\%} CI], -205 [-265 to -144] kcal/d), intermediate with the low-glycemic index diet (-166 [-227 to -106] kcal/d), and least with the very low-carbohydrate diet (-138 [-198 to -77] kcal/d; overall P = .03; P for trend by glycemic load = .009). The decrease in TEE showed a similar pattern (mean [95{\%} CI], -423 [-606 to -239] kcal/d; -297 [-479 to -115] kcal/d; and -97 [-281 to 86] kcal/d, respectively; overall P = .003; P for trend by glycemic load {\textless} .001). Hormone levels and metabolic syndrome components also varied during weight maintenance by diet (leptin, P {\textless} .001; 24-hour urinary cortisol, P = .005; indexes of peripheral [P = .02] and hepatic [P = .03] insulin sensitivity; high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, P {\textless} .001; non-HDL cholesterol, P {\textless} .001; triglycerides, P {\textless} .001; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, P for trend = .04; and C-reactive protein, P for trend = .05), but no consistent favorable pattern emerged. CONCLUSION Among overweight and obese young adults compared with pre-weight-loss energy expenditure, isocaloric feeding following 10{\%} to 15{\%} weight loss resulted in decreases in REE and TEE that were greatest with the low-fat diet, intermediate with the low-glycemic index diet, and least with the very low-carbohydrate diet.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown that a deterioration of skin properties, an impaired cutaneous microcirculatory function and an imbalance of autonomic nervous activity are observed in smokers and in patients with diabetes mellitus or Raynaud's phenomenon. These observations suggest that skin properties are associated with cutaneous microcirculatory function and autonomic nervous activity in pathological conditions. However, there is no published evidence to support the concept that these two functions have any relationship with skin properties even in healthy subjects. To investigate the hypothesis that these properties are related, we conducted a survey of healthy adult subjects to investigate the relationships between cutaneous microcirculatory function and autonomic nervous activity and skin properties. METHODS: The hydration of the stratum corneum and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were investigated as skin properties, and the responsiveness of skin blood flow (SkBF) to local warming was examined as an index of cutaneous microcirculatory function in 19 healthy adult male subjects. Electrocardiograms were monitored for 24 h and heart rate variability was analysed considering low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.40 Hz) and a ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF) as indices of autonomic nervous activity; HF is an index of parasympathetic activity, whereas LF/HF is an index of sympathovagal balance. The relationships between those indices were then analysed. RESULTS: A moderate negative correlation was found between TEWL and the relative maximum rate of increases in the responsiveness of SkBF on local warming. A moderate positive and a moderate negative correlation were observed between TEWL and LF/HF or HF, respectively. Moreover, a moderate negative and a moderate positive correlation were shown between the responsiveness of SkBF and LF/HF or HF, respectively. The hydration of the stratum corneum showed no correlations with any indices of microcirculation or autonomic nervous activity. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that skin barrier function, cutaneous microcirculatory function and autonomic nervous activity are mutually associated in healthy adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Dietary patterns in Western populations have been linked to type 2 diabetes, but the association of distinctive dietary patterns of Japanese population remains unclear. We prospectively investigated the association between dietary patterns and risk of developing type 2 diabetes among Japanese adults. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants were 27, 816 men and 36,889 women aged 45-74 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study and had no history of diabetes. Dietary patterns were derived by using principal component analysis of the consumption of 134 food and beverage items ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios of self-reported physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over 5 year were estimated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1194 new cases (692 men and 502 women) of type 2 diabetes were self-reported. We identified three dietary patterns: prudent, westernized and traditional Japanese patterns. Any dietary pattern was not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk after adjustment for covariates in both men and women. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95{\%} confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes for the highest versus lowest quartile of each dietary pattern score in men and women, respectively, were 0.93 (0.74-1.16) and 0.90 (0.69-1.16) for the prudent pattern, 1.15 (0.90-1.46) and 0.81 (0.61-1.08) for the westernized pattern, and 0.97 (0.74-1.27) and 0.87 (0.66-1.15) for the traditional pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Although a small protective effect of the prudent dietary pattern cannot be excluded, dietary patterns may not be appreciably associated with type 2 diabetes risk in Japanese.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship between circulating adiponectin, leptin and vaspin with bone mineral density (BMD), arterial stiffness and vascular calcification in post-menopausal women. We hypothesised that adipokines produced by adipose tissue may be mediators of bone and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and explain, in part, the observed association between osteoporosis and CVD. DESIGN We studied 386 ambulant community dwelling postmenopausal women aged (mean [SD] 61 [6.4] years). BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH), body composition; fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM) as well as abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) were determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index, markers of arterial stiffness were measured. Fasting adiponectin, leptin and vaspin were quantified in serum. RESULTS A positive independent association was observed between vaspin and BMD at the FN (p = 0.009), TH (p = 0.037) in the whole study population adjusted for confounders including age, FM, LM and lifestyle variables. Using the same model, a negative association was seen between adiponectin and BMD at the FN in women with osteoporosis (p = 0.043). Serum adiponectin was significantly higher in women with fractures (20.8 [9.3] µg/ml compared to those without (18.5 [8.6] µg/ml, p = 0.018) and associated with a significant increased risk of fracture (HR 1.032, 95{\%} CI 1.003-1.063, p = 0.032). Leptin was not associated with BMD or fracture risk after adjustment. Adiponectin was independently associated with AAC (p = 0.007) and significantly higher in women with AAC scores {\textgreater} 1; (19.2[9.2]) compared to those with no or low AAC scores ({\textless}1); 16.8 [8.0], p = 0.018). In adjusted analyses, PWV velocity was positively associated with circulating vaspin (p = 0.039) and AI was negatively associated with serum leptin (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Adiponectin, leptin, vaspin are related to markers of bone and vascular health and may contribute to the observed association between osteoporosis and CVD.},

abstract = {Glycidol fatty acid esters (GEs) have been found as impurities in refined edible oils including diacylglycerol (DAG) oil, and concerns of possible exposure to glycidol (G), a known animal carcinogen, during digestion have been raised. We previously measured N-(2,3-dihydroxy-propyl)valine (diHOPrVal), a G hemoglobin adduct, for DAG oil exposed and non-exposed groups and showed there was no significant difference between them. In the present study, we conducted an additional analysis to verify the outcome of the previous report. The first experiment was designed as a matched case-control study to adjust variables with an increased sample size. The average levels of diHOPrVal were 6.9. pmol/g-globin (95{\%}CI: 4.9-9.0) for 14 DAG oil exposed subjects and 7.3 pmol/g-globin (95{\%}CI: 6.1-8.5) for 42 non-exposed volunteers, and no significant difference in levels was found between the two groups. In a second experiment, we compared the adduct levels of 12 DAG oil exposed subjects before and after discontinuing use of DAG oil, and found there was no significant change in diHOPrVal levels (from 7.1 ± 1.1 to 7.5 ± 1.4. pmol/g-globin). These results suggest that there was no increased exposure to G for humans who ingested DAG oil daily, although the evaluated population was limited. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A new method to image and quantify intra-abdominal haemorrhage using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was tested in vivo. Supine peritoneal dialysis patients were monitored using an 8-electrode hemiarray placed on the anterior abdomen. EIT measurements were recorded using the EPack II data acquisition system before, during, and after the administration of dialysate. The amount of dialysate infused was recorded synchronous with EIT measurements and used as a control. Tomographic images of impedance change were reconstructed using a weighted, sensitivity-based method and then post-processed to obtain a quantitative estimate of the total dialysate volume added and the rate of dialysate administration. Our preliminary study included two subjects, one male and one female, each of whom participated for two sessions spaced about 6 months apart. Data collected from these sessions indicated that with an in vivo SNR of about 35 dB the EPack II can detect accumulations larger than about 100 ml, with a quantification uncertainty of about 50 ml. The rate of accumulation was determined in less than 2 min. This method shows promise for automated detection of other pathologies, eg ascites, and is adaptable to detecting conductive accumulations in other anatomy.},

abstract = {The dorsal striatum plays a role in consummatory food reward, and striatal dopamine receptors are reduced in obese individuals, relative to lean individuals, which suggests that the striatum and dopaminergic signaling in the striatum may contribute to the development of obesity. Thus, we tested whether striatal activation in response to food intake is related to current and future increases in body mass and whether these relations are moderated by the presence of the A1 allele of the TaqIA restriction fragment length polymorphism, which is associated with dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene binding in the striatum and compromised striatal dopamine signaling. Cross-sectional and prospective data from two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies support these hypotheses, which implies that individuals may overeat to compensate for a hypofunctioning dorsal striatum, particularly those with genetic polymorphisms thought to attenuate dopamine signaling in this region.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Regional fat is increasingly recognized as a determinant of bone mineral density (BMD), an association that may be mediated by adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, and inflammatory fat products. Chronic inflammation is deleterious to bone, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) predicts inflammatory markers such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin, whereas sc adipose tissue (SAT) and VAT predict IL-6 in adolescents. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine associations of regional fat mass and adipokines with BMD. We hypothesized that girls with greater VAT relative to SAT would have lower bone density mediated by inflammatory cytokines, adiponectin, and leptin. DESIGN This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING The study was conducted at a clinical research center. SUBJECTS SUBJECTS included 30 girls (15 obese, 15 normal weight) 12-18 yr old, matched for maturity (bone age), race, and ethnicity. OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed regional fat (SAT, VAT) using magnetic resonance imaging, total fat, and BMD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Fasting leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were obtained. RESULTS Mean body mass index sd score was 3.7 +/- 1.5 in obese subjects and 0.1 +/- 0.4 kg/m(2) in controls. VAT was a negative predictor of spine BMD and bone mineral apparent density, whole-body BMD and bone mineral content/height in obese girls and whole-body BMD and bone mineral content/height for the group as a whole after controlling for SAT, as was the ratio of VAT to SAT. In a regression model that included VAT/SAT, adipokines, and cytokines, E-selectin and adiponectin were negative predictors of BMD and leptin a positive predictor. CONCLUSION VAT is an independent inverse determinant of bone density in obesity. This association may be mediated by adipokines and a chronic inflammatory state.},

abstract = {Bariatric surgery results in rapid weight loss and beneficial metabolic effects, but may have negative effects on the skeleton. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate changes in bone metabolism in response to bariatric surgery with two surgical techniques. 46 morbidly obese subjects (mean 44.9 years, BMI 42.1) with (n = 19) or without (n = 27) type 2 diabetes (T2DM) at baseline underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 21) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG, n = 25). Bone turnover markers (CTX, PINP, TRAcP5b, TotalOC and ucOC) were measured before and six months after surgery. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at lumbar spine and vertebral bone marrow (VBM) fat were measured in 21 subjects (7 RYGB and 14 SG) with three-dimensional quantitative computer tomography and1H MR spectroscopy, respectively. 25 non-obese subjects were recruited as controls (mean 45.8 years, BMI 23.0) and assessed at a single cross-sectional visit. Obese subjects had significantly lower bone turnover at baseline when compared to non-obese controls. Bone metabolic markers markedly increased post-operatively (p {\textless} 0.0001 for all). The activation of bone remodeling was significantly higher after RYGB than after SG and was particularly observed in patients, whose type 2 diabetes was in remission after weight loss. There was no change in volumetric BMD or marrow fat at lumbar spine six months after surgery in our sample. In conclusion, severe obesity decreases bone remodeling, which is activated after bariatric surgery. The increase in bone turnover after surgery is affected by the choice of surgical technique and by the post-surgery remission of T2DM.},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue that plays a central role in human health and disease. Aging is associated with a decrease in muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) that is associated with a loss of independence and reduced quality of life. Gut microbiota, the bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotic microbes residing in the gastrointestinal tract are emerging as a potential contributor to age-associated muscle decline. Specifically, advancing age is characterized by a dysbiosis of gut microbiota that is associated with increased intestinal permeability, facilitating the passage of endotoxin and other microbial products (e.g., indoxyl sulfate) into the circulation. Upon entering the circulation, LPS and other microbial factors promote inflammatory signaling and skeletal muscle changes that are hallmarks of the aging muscle phenotype. This review will summarize existing literature suggesting cross-talk between gut microbiota and skeletal muscle health, with emphasis on the significance of this axis for mediating changes in aging skeletal muscle size, composition, and function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that hyperlipidemia contributes to the progression of renal disease. A large trial has not been performed; however, a number of small, controlled trials have been reported. We examined the effects of antilipemic agents on glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria or albuminuria in patients with renal disease. METHODS: We used Medline, abstracts from scientific meetings, and bibliographies from recent reviews and scientific reports to locate pertinent studies. Thirteen prospective controlled trials examining the effects of antilipemic agents on renal function, proteinuria, or albuminuria were included. Studies were published as full reports or abstracts and were at least three months in duration. For five of the studies, individual patient data were obtained. Other summary data were independently extracted from the published reports by two investigators and included study quality, subject characteristics, cause of renal disease, change in serum cholesterol, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and albuminuria. RESULTS: There was a lower rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate with treatment compared with controls (treated controls, 0.156 mL/min/month; 95{\%} CI, 0.026 to 0. 285 mL/min/month, P = 0.008). The study results were statistically homogeneous, and in a regression analysis, the effect of treatment on glomerular filtration rate did not correlate with study quality, the percentage change in cholesterol, the type of lipid-lowering agent, or the cause of renal disease. However, longer follow-up correlated with the amount of improvement in glomerular filtration rate from treatment (P = 0.007). There was a tendency for a favorable effect of treatment on protein or albumin excretion [Ln (treatment) - Ln (control) = -0.248, 95{\%} CI, -0.562 to 0.064, P = 0. 077]. However, these results were statistically heterogeneous between studies (P {\textless} 0.001). No obvious explanation for this heterogeneity was apparent in a regression analysis examining potential reasons for differences in study results. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid reduction may preserve glomerular filtration rate and may decrease proteinuria in patients with renal disease.},

The study was designed as a randomized double-blind controlled trial. Twenty-two Japanese participants (10 men, 12 women) aged 60-73 y were assigned to one of two groups (11 [5 men, 6 women] in each). One group received MFGM tablets (1 g MFGM/d), and the other received placebo tablets daily for 10 wk. Both groups participated in a twice-weekly light exercise program. Physical function tests and surface electromyography (EMG) were conducted at the baseline and after 5 and 10 wk. Chair stand time significantly shortened in both groups after 10 wk compared with that at the baseline. The average time shortened more considerably in the MFGM group than in the placebo group, although the change was not statistically significant. Both knee extension strength and the cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscles significantly increased from baseline in the MFGM group but not in the placebo group. Surface EMG showed that muscle fiber conduction velocity increased significantly after 10 wk from the baseline only in the MFGM group. The increase from the baseline was significantly greater in the MFGM group than in the placebo group. Daily supplementation with MFGM increased motor unit action potential conduction and improved muscle strength and physical performance in healthy Japanese adults aged 60 y and over paired with semiweekly light exercise.},

abstract = {The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a practical clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for age-related sarcopenia. EWGSOP included representatives from four participant organisations, i.e. the European Geriatric Medicine Society, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics—European Region and the International Association of Nutrition and Aging. These organisations endorsed the findings in the final document. The group met and addressed the following questions, using the medical literature to build evidence-based answers: (i) What is sarcopenia? (ii) What parameters define sarcopenia? (iii) What variables reflect these parameters, and what measurement tools and cut-off points can be used? (iv) How does sarcopenia relate to cachexia, frailty and sarcopenic obesity? For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass + low muscle function (strength or performance). EWGSOP variously applies these characteristics to further define conceptual stages as ‘presarcopenia', ‘sarcopenia' and ‘severe sarcopenia'. EWGSOP reviewed a wide range of tools that can be used to measure the specific variables of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Our paper summarises currently available data defining sarcopenia cut-off points by age and gender; suggests an algorithm for sarcopenia case finding in older individuals based on measurements of gait speed, grip strength and muscle mass; and presents a list of suggested primary and secondary outcome domains for research. Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment.},

We demonstrate that ggplot2 can be used as the basis for producing specialized plotting packages and, in the present case, a package has been developed specifically for the production of high quality ternary diagrams. In order to produce ggtern, it was necessary to overcome a number of design issues, such as finding a means to modify existing geometries designed for a 2D Cartesian coordinate system and permitting them to function in an environment that requires an additional spatial aesthetic mapping. In the present paper, we provide examples of this package in its most basic form followed by a demonstration of its ease of use, particularly if one is familiar with, and has a predilection towards using ggplot2 on a regular basis.},

METHODS In this 2-year trial, we randomly assigned 322 moderately obese subjects (mean age, 52 years; mean body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31; male sex, 86{\%}) to one of three diets: low-fat, restricted-calorie; Mediterranean, restricted-calorie; or low-carbohydrate, non-restricted-calorie. RESULTS The rate of adherence to a study diet was 95.4{\%} at 1 year and 84.6{\%} at 2 years. The Mediterranean-diet group consumed the largest amounts of dietary fiber and had the highest ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat (P{\textless}0.05 for all comparisons among treatment groups). The low-carbohydrate group consumed the smallest amount of carbohydrates and the largest amounts of fat, protein, and cholesterol and had the highest percentage of participants with detectable urinary ketones (P{\textless}0.05 for all comparisons among treatment groups). The mean weight loss was 2.9 kg for the low-fat group, 4.4 kg for the Mediterranean-diet group, and 4.7 kg for the low-carbohydrate group (P{\textless}0.001 for the interaction between diet group and time); among the 272 participants who completed the intervention, the mean weight losses were 3.3 kg, 4.6 kg, and 5.5 kg, respectively. The relative reduction in the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 20{\%} in the low-carbohydrate group and 12{\%} in the low-fat group (P=0.01). Among the 36 subjects with diabetes, changes in fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels were more favorable among those assigned to the Mediterranean diet than among those assigned to the low-fat diet (P{\textless}0.001 for the interaction among diabetes and Mediterranean diet and time with respect to fasting glucose levels). CONCLUSIONS Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets may be effective alternatives to low-fat diets. The more favorable effects on lipids (with the low-carbohydrate diet) and on glycemic control (with the Mediterranean diet) suggest that personal preferences and metabolic considerations might inform individualized tailoring of dietary interventions.

abstract = {The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is a weak potential or magnetic response elicited by periodic acoustic stimuli with a maximum response at about a 40-Hz periodicity. In most previous studies using amplitude-modulated (AM) tones of stimulus sound, long lasting tones of more than 10 s in length were used. However, characteristics of the ASSR elicited by short AM tones have remained unclear. In this study, we examined magnetoencephalographic (MEG) ASSR using a sequence of sinusoidal AM tones of 0.78 s in length with various tone frequencies of 440-990 Hz in about one octave variation. It was found that the amplitude of the ASSR was invariant with tone frequencies when the level of sound pressure was adjusted along an equal-loudness curve. The amplitude also did not depend on the existence of preceding tone or difference in frequency of the preceding tone. When the sound level of AM tones was changed with tone frequencies in the same range of 440-990 Hz, the amplitude of ASSR varied in a proportional manner to the sound level. These characteristics are favorable for the use of ASSR in studying temporal processing of auditory information in the auditory cortex. The lack of adaptation in the ASSR elicited by a sequence of short tones may be ascribed to the neural activity of widely accepted generator of magnetic ASSR in the primary auditory cortex. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

McIntosh and Pepe (2002, Biometrics58, 657-644) showed that the risk score, Compositional explanatory variables should not be directly used in a linear regression model because any inference statistic can become misleading. While various approaches for this problem were proposed, here an approach based on the isometric logratio (ilr) transformation is used. It turns out that the resulting model is easy to handle, and that parameter estimation can be done in like in usual linear regression. Moreover, it is possible to use the ilr variables for inference statistics in order to obtain an appropriate interpretation of the model.},

To overcome the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, Tikhonov regularization (TIK) and truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) are commonly used by choosing the appropriate regularization parameter and truncation parameter, respectively. We have developed a minimal product method (MINP) to determine the regularization and truncation parameters. The present computer simulation and experimental results indicate that the MINP can be easily implemented in both TIK and TSVD with satisfactory performance, and suggest the potential applications of the MINP method in determining the corner of the L-curve.},

Studies of genetic polymorphisms for coffee metabolism were excluded.Results The umbrella review identified 201 meta-analyses of observational research with 67 unique health outcomes and 17 meta-analyses of interventional research with nine unique outcomes. Coffee consumption was more often associated with benefit than harm for a range of health outcomes across exposures including high versus low, any versus none, and one extra cup a day. There was evidence of a non-linear association between consumption and some outcomes, with summary estimates indicating largest relative risk reduction at intakes of three to four cups a day versus none, including all cause mortality (relative risk 0.83, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.83 to 0.88), cardiovascular mortality (0.81, 0.72 to 0.90), and cardiovascular disease (0.85, 0.80 to 0.90). High versus low consumption was associated with an 18{\%} lower risk of incident cancer (0.82, 0.74 to 0.89). Consumption was also associated with a lower risk of several specific cancers and neurological, metabolic, and liver conditions. Harmful associations were largely nullified by adequate adjustment for smoking, except in pregnancy, where high versus low/no consumption was associated with low birth weight (odds ratio 1.31, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.03 to 1.67), preterm birth in the first (1.22, 1.00 to 1.49) and second (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22) trimester, and pregnancy loss (1.46, 1.06 to 1.99). There was also an association between coffee drinking and risk of fracture in women but not in men.Conclusion Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Although the metabolic abnormalities are often developed in Asians with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2, the characteristics of the non-obese Asians with metabolic abnormality have not been fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of insulin sensitivity in Japanese men with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study, we defined that hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia are cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF). We recruited the subjects who met the selection criteria as below; men with BMI of 21 to 23 kg/m2 and no CMRF (n=24), men with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2 and no CMRF (n=28), 1 CMRF (n=28), and {\textgreater}/=2 CMRF (n=14), and 20 overweight men with metabolic syndrome (OWMS). Insulin sensitivity (IS) and ectopic fat content in muscle and liver were measured by two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. RESULTS: Among subjects with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2, impaired IS in muscle, but not in liver, was found in those with even 1 CMRF, while impaired IS in both muscle and liver was observed in OWMS. Liver fat accumulation and elevated liver enzymes were associated with impaired IS in both muscle and liver in those subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Among Japanese men with BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2, muscle insulin resistance was present in those with even one CMRF. In this population, liver fat accumulation and/or elevated liver enzymes could be a good marker for impaired IS in both muscle and liver.},

abstract = {It was previously believed that obesity and osteoporosis were two unrelated diseases, but recent studies have shown that both diseases share several common genetic and environmental factors. Body fat mass, a component of body weight, is one of the most important indices of obesity, and a substantial body of evidence indicates that fat mass may have beneficial effects on bone. Contrasting studies, however, suggest that excessive fat mass may not protect against osteoporosis or osteoporotic fracture. Differences in experimental design, sample structure, and even the selection of covariates may account for some of these inconsistent or contradictory results. Despite the lack of a clear consensus regarding the impact of effects of fat on bone, a number of mechanistic explanations have been proposed to support the observed epidemiologic and physiologic associations between fat and bone. The common precursor stem cell that leads to the differentiation of both adipocytes and osteoblasts, as well the secretion of adipocyte-derived hormones that affect bone development, may partially explain these associations. Based on our current state of knowledge, it is unclear whether fat has beneficial effects on bone. We anticipate that this will be an active and fruitful focus of research in the coming years.},

Five hundred and ten of the index patients tested positive for influenza A (subtype H3N2). A standardised daily questionnaire allowed for identification of secondary cases of influenza among their household contacts, who were followed-up for 15 days. Of the 395 (77{\%}) households that completed the questionnaire, we selected 279 where no additional cases had occurred on the day of the index patient's visit to the GP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Secondary cases of influenza were those household contacts who had developed clinical influenza within 5 days of the disease onset in the index patient. Hazard ratios for individual clinical and demographic characteristics of the contact and their index patient were derived from a Cox regression model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall in the 279 households, 131 (24.1{\%}) secondary cases occurred among the 543 household contacts. There was an increased risk of influenza transmission in preschool contacts (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 3.26) as compared with school-age and adult contacts. There was also an increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients (HR = 1.93, 95{\%} CI = 1.09 to 3.42) and school-age index patients (HR = 1.68, 95{\%} CI = 1.07 to 2.65), compared with those exposed to adult index cases. No other factor was associated with transmission of the disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results support the major role of children in the dissemination of influenza in households. Vaccination of children or prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors would prevent, respectively, 32-38{\%} and 21-41{\%} of secondary cases caused by exposure to a sick child in the household.},

abstract = {A clustering of metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, all of which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), occurs more often than by chance. Numerous epidemiological studies, as well as basic researches, have revealed that visceral fat accumulation is closely involved in this risk clustering. This morbid condition is now well recognized as the metabolic syndrome. The concept of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., the involvement of visceral adiposity in the clustering of CVD risk factors, implies that an effective CVD risk reduction will be accomplished by an intervention to reduce visceral fat deposits. The primary strategy of the intervention is lifestyle modification, which can be put into practice in healthcare fields, without necessity of medical treatment. Now that CVD is a leading global health burden, the metabolic syndrome attracts increasing attention in the world. To take global action against the syndrome, several working groups developed its internationally unified diagnostic criteria. Most recently, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) jointly proposed the criteria, although some cautions will be needed in their practical use. In this review, we mainly focus on the findings observed in clinical and epidemiological studies, to discuss a practical strategy of the management of the metabolic syndrome in healthcare fields.},

abstract = {It has been well documented that the frequency of vasomotor menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats, of Japanese menopausal women is less than that of Western women. High intake of soy isoflavones in the traditional Japanese diet has been postulated as the possible explanation of the difference. Epidemiological studies have reported that the content of equol, which is a biologically active metabolite of the isoflavone, daidzein, is lower in the women who complain of severe vasomotor symptoms. To investigate the involvement of equol in the manifestation of menopausal symptoms, especially vasomotor symptoms, and the possible therapeutic role of a supplement containing equol (natural S-equol developed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical) on the menopausal symptoms of Japanese women, 3 randomized clinical trials were conducted. The studies indicated that a daily dose of 10 mg of natural S-equol improved menopausal symptoms. In the confirmation study, menopausal women who were equol nonproducers who consumed 10 mg/d of natural S-equol for 12 wk had significantly reduced severity and frequency of hot flashes as well as a significant reduction in the severity of neck or shoulder stiffness. The equol-ingesting group also showed trends of improvement in sweating and irritability and a significant improvement in the somatic category symptoms. Thus, it is concluded that the supplement containing natural S-equol, a novel soybean-derived functional component, has a promising role as an alternative remedy in the management of menopausal symptoms.},

For this purpose, we prepared a measurement device and bioequivalent phantoms, measured the electrical characteristics of the phantoms, and validated the method using the phantoms. Monolayer phantoms mimicking the brain and muscle and bilayer phantoms consisting of muscle and brain layers were prepared. The relative differences between the measured electrical conductivities of the monolayer brain and muscle phantoms and the true values determined by the 4-electrode method were both less than 10{\%}. The relative differences between the measured and true values in the bilayer phantoms were less than 20{\%} in both layers. The biological impedance measurement device that we developed was confirmed to be effective for impedance measurement in bilayer phantoms with different electrical impedances. To develop a device for the early diagnosis of breast diseases, the development of a multi-layer phantom and demonstration of the effectiveness of the device for its examination are necessary. If the device that we developed makes impedance measurement in breast tumors possible, it may be used as a new diagnostic modality for breast diseases.},

abstract = {Multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography has been evolving from the frequency-sweep approach to the multi-frequency simultaneous measurement technique which can reduce measuring time and will be increasingly attractive for time-varying biological applications. The accuracy and stability of the current source are the key factors determining the quality of the image reconstruction. This article presents a field programmable gate array-based current source for a multi-frequency simultaneous electrical impedance tomography system. A novel current source circuit was realized by combining the classic current mirror based on the feedback amplifier AD844 with a differential topology. The optimal phase offsets of harmonic sinusoids were obtained through the crest factor analysis. The output characteristics of this current source were evaluated by simulation and actual measurement. The results include the following: (1) the output impedance was compared with one of the Howland pump circuit in simulation, showing comparable performance at low frequencies. However, the proposed current source makes lower demands for resistor tolerance but performs even better at high frequencies. (2) The output impedance in actual measurement below 200 kHz is above 1.3 M$\Omega$ and can reach 250 K$\Omega$ up to 1 MHz. (3) An experiment based on a biological RC model has been implemented. The mean error for the demodulated impedance amplitude and phase are 0.192{\%} and 0.139°, respectively. Therefore, the proposed current source is wideband, biocompatible, and high precision, which demonstrates great potential to work as a sub-system in the multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography system.},

The average decrement in VAT per 30 minute/day increase in MVPA was -453 cm(3) (95{\%} CI -574, -331). The association was attenuated but persisted upon adjustment for BMI (-122 cm(3), P=0.002). Higher levels of MVPA were associated with higher SAT HU (all P≤0.01), a marker of fat quality, even after adjustment for SAT volume. Similar findings were observed in men but the magnitude of the association was less. Sedentary time was not associated with SAT or VAT volume or quality in men or women. CONCLUSIONS MVPA was associated with less VAT and SAT and better fat quality.},

abstract = {The National Nutrition Survey in Japan (J-NNS), an annual nationwide survey on nutrition and diet of the Japanese people, is reviewed. J-NNS was started in the Tokyo Metropolitan area in 1945 following the end of World War II. The survey area was gradually expanded and became nationwide in 1948. The current survey obtains data from more than 12,000 persons of approximately 5,000 randomly selected households. The survey consists of three parts: a physical examination, a dietary intake survey and a dietary habit questionnaire. The physical examination includes anthropometric measurements and a blood test, the dietary intake survey examines nutrient/food intake with a semi-weighed recording method, and the dietary habit questionnaire monitors nutrition/diet-consciousness and dietary habits. In this review, the aim and brief history of the survey are outlined in the first section. The following section, explains its administrative framework, target population, sampling method, annual schedule and question items, focusing on their historical transition. Then the findings of the J-NNS are summarized, which highlights annual changes in the intake of energy, macronutrients, micronutrients and food groups. The current findings of the dietary habit questionnaire are also given in brief.},

We conducted a genome-wide association study of 5006 Caucasian individuals drawn from two cohorts of men: the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. We identified two independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with circulating retinol levels, which are located near the transthyretin (TTR) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) genes which encode major carrier proteins of retinol: rs1667255 (P =2.30× 10(-17)) and rs10882272 (P =6.04× 10(-12)). We replicated the association with rs10882272 in RBP4 in independent samples from the Nurses' Health Study and the Invecchiare in Chianti Study (InCHIANTI) that included 3792 women and 504 men (P =9.49× 10(-5)), but found no association for retinol with rs1667255 in TTR among women, thus suggesting evidence for gender dimorphism (P-interaction=1.31× 10(-5)). Discovery of common genetic variants associated with serum retinol levels may provide further insight into the contribution of retinol and other vitamin A compounds to the development of cancer and other complex diseases.},

abstract = {Background: The mechanisms of skin breakdown induced by incontinence have been proposed from a variety of experimental studies. However, studies on the influence of skin properties caused by incontinence of bedridden subjects are very limited. Objective: This work was conducted to reveal how incontinence influences skin properties by comparing bedridden incontinent elderly subjects with age-matched healthy continent elderly and middle-aged subjects. Methods: Bedridden incontinent elderly subjects (n = 35, 83.5 +/- 9.7 years, mean age +/- SD), healthy continent elderly (n = 41, 75.9 +/- 5.6 years), and middle-aged (n = 20, 41.3 +/- 2.8 years) were recruited for this study. Skin surface pH, capacitance/hydration, transepidermal water loss, and bacteria on forearm and buttock skin were measured. Results: Hydration and transepidermal water loss values between healthy elderly subjects and incontinent elderly subjects were significantly different on buttock skin. Significant differences between those two groups were also observed regarding pH and total bacteria levels on buttock skin. The forearm skin showed no significant difference in these parameters. No significant influence was observed between with and without urination at the measurement time except for the pH of buttock skin. No significant correlation was observed except between pH and bacteria levels on buttock skin of incontinent elderly subjects. Conclusion: In this study, we clarified the characteristic features of skin induced by incontinence. Our results indicate that these parameters are adequate not only to evaluate the characteristic skin features of bedridden incontinent subjects but also to develop new diapers to avoid the diaper dermatitis caused by incontinence.},

abstract = {Adipocytes can highly and specifically express adiponectin, and the adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) has been detected in bone-forming cells. The present study was undertaken to investigate the action of adiponectin on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. AdipoR1 protein was detected in human osteoblasts. Adiponectin promoted osteoblast proliferation and resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin and type I collagen production, and an increase in mineralized matrix. Suppression of AdipoR1 with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the adiponectin-induced cell proliferation and ALP expression. Adiponectin induces activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), but not ERK1/2 in osteoblasts, and these effects were blocked by suppression of AdipoR1 with siRNA. Furthermore, pretreatment of osteoblasts with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished the adiponectin-induced cell proliferation. p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked the adiponectin-induced ALP activity. These data indicate that adiponectin induces human osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and the proliferation response is mediated by the AdipoR/JNK pathway, while the differentiation response is mediated via the AdipoR/p38 pathway. These findings suggest that osteoblasts are the direct targets of adiponectin.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The development of diabetic nephropathy is considered to be associated with oxidative stress. NADPH oxidase and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) have attracted attention as mechanisms of generating oxidative stress. We studied the relation between the genotypes of the NADPH p22phox C242T and RAGE G1704T polymorphisms and the development of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using a retrospective review of clinical data, we allocated 181 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients to one of two groups: patients without diabetic nephropathy (group N; n = 108) and patients developing diabetic nephropathy (group D; n = 73) for 10 years or more. The p22phox C242T and RAGE G1704T polymorphisms were examined by Taqman PCR methods. RESULTS The frequency of the p22phox CC genotype was significantly higher in group D than in group N (90 vs. 79{\%}; P = 0.0427). The frequency of the RAGE GT + TT genotype was significantly higher in group D than in group N (26 vs. 13{\%}; P = 0.0313). The frequency of the combination of p22phox CC and RAGE GT + TT genotypes was significantly higher in group D than in group N (22 vs. 8{\%}; P = 0.0057). In multiple logistic regression analysis, systolic blood pressure, HbA(1c), triglycerides, and the combination of polymorphisms were shown to be independent variables. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that assessment of the combination of NADPH p22phox C242T and RAGE G1704T polymorphisms may be useful in identifying the risk for developing diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients.},

Genetic associates of BMI (FTO(rs9939609)) and circulating CRP (CRP(rs3091244)) have been used to reexamine observational associations between them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Observational analyses showed a strong, positive association between circulating CRP and BMI (change in BMI for a doubling in log CRP of 1.03 kg m(-2) (95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 1.00, 1.07), P{\textless}0.0001). Analysis using CRP(rs3091244) to re-estimate the causal effect of circulating CRP on BMI yielded null effects (change in BMI for a doubling in log CRP of -0.24 kg m(-2) (95{\%} CI: -0.58, 0.11), P=0.2). In contrast, analysis using FTO(rs9939609) to assess the causal effect of BMI on circulating CRP confirmed observational associations (ratio of geometric means of CRP per s.d. increase in BMI 1.41 (95{\%} CI: 1.10, 1.80), P=0.006).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that the observed association between circulating CRP and measured BMI is likely to be driven by BMI, with CRP being a marker of elevated adiposity.

After the 12-week intervention, the S-(-)equol group had a greater decrease from baseline in hot flush frequency compared with the placebo group (-1.9(plus or minus)1.8/day, -58.7{\%}, vs. -1.0(plus or minus)2.0/day, -34.5{\%}, p=0.009). The severity of hot flushes and neck or shoulder muscle stiffness significantly decreased in the S-(-)equol group compared with the placebo group. No changes in clinical parameters or serious adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: This is the first trial to show beneficial effects of a 10-mg natural S-(-)equol supplement consumed daily for 12 weeks on major menopausal symptoms, specifically, hot flushes and neck or shoulder muscle stiffness, in postmenopausal Japanese women. This supplement offers a promising alternative for management of menopausal symptoms. (copyright) Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.},

abstract = {Osteoporosis is one of chief complications of anorexia nervosa. Their calcium intake decreases and 84{\%}are lack of vitamin D. The abnormal bone metabolism in severely emaciated patients with anorexia nervosa involves both a reduction in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption. The annual change in lumbar bone mineral density(BMD)is significantly correlated with body mass index(BMI)at the entry. The critical BMI for a positive increase in BMD was 16.4±0.3 kg/m2. Since 30{\%}of patients are lack of vitamin K, their bone quality deteriorates. The risk factors of a decrease in lumbar vertebrae BMD is a duration of emaciation when both serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-Ⅰ as a potent osteogenic factor and estradiol as a powerful bone resorption inhibitor decrease. Therefore, the prevention and the treatment are weight gain. However, the patient does not accept weight gain easily. Active form vitamin D3 of 0.5$\mu$g/day or 30-45 mg/day of vitamin K2 preparation prevents the further decrease in bone mineral density. Eldecalcitol of 0.5$\mu$g/day shows about 5{\%}increase in lumbar vertebrae BMD in first year. Bisphosphonate and a RANK ligand inhibitors, denosumab should not be used for young patients and women in hope of the pregnancy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study investigated the relationship between frequency of skipping breakfast and annual changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). METHODS The participants were 4,430 factory employees. BMI and WC were measured repeatedly at annual medical examinations over a 5-year period. The association between frequency of skipping breakfast at the baseline examination and annual changes in anthropometric indices was evaluated using the generalized estimating equation method. RESULTS The mean (standard deviation) BMI was 23.3 (3.0) kg m-2 for men and 21.9 (3.6) kg m-2 for women; and the mean WC was 82.6 (8.7) cm for men and 77.8 (9.8) cm for women. During the follow-up period, mean BMI increased by 0.2 kg m-2 for men and women, and mean WC increased by 1.1 cm for men and 1.0 cm for women. The annual change in the BMI of men who skipped breakfast four to six times per week was 0.061 kg m-2 higher, and that of those who skipped breakfast seven times per week was 0.046 kg m-2 higher, compared with those who did not skip breakfast. Annual changes in the WC of male participants who skipped breakfast seven times per week was 0.248 cm higher than that of those who did not skip breakfast. Skipping breakfast was not associated with changes in BMI or WC in women. CONCLUSIONS Skipping breakfast was closely associated with annual changes in BMI and WC among men, and eating breakfast more than four times per week may prevent the excessive body weight gain associated with skipping breakfast.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s). Purpose: The nutritional changes that have accompanied the modernization of Japanese dietary patterns have led to significant increases in the number of people who are overweight or obese. This study aimed to clarify the effects of these nutritional changes on postprandial energy expenditure and the release of metabolism-regulating hormones. Methods: The total daily energy content (20 {\%} breakfast, 40 {\%} lunch, and 40 {\%} dinner) and macronutrient composition (carbohydrate/fat/protein) was 8807.3 kJ and 364.3:30.1:66.4 (g) for the traditional test diet and 9217.6 kJ and 331.7:66.1:76.9 (g) for the modern test diet. In experiment 1, nine healthy Japanese men participated in a crossover study during which they ingested a test diet comprising three meals; postprandial blood parameters were measured after each meal. In experiment 2, another ten men participated in a crossover study during which they ingested 2 meals, after which metabolic responses and blood variables were evaluated. Results: The modern diet induced greater blood levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and ghrelin than did the traditional diet. The expected increase in postprandial energy expenditure (∆REE) tended to be dampened after the modern compared with the traditional diet. GIP was inversely correlated with ∆REE after lunch, and ghrelin was positively associated with ∆REE. Conclusion: Both GIP and ghrelin are robust indicators of postprandial energy expenditure. The nutritional changes accompanying the modernization of Japanese dietary patterns may increase the levels of the anabolic intestinal hormone GIP, which is associated with ∆REE, in the Japanese population. The contribution of an increased ghrelin concentration to the decreased ∆REE after the modern diet warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is assuming a prominent role as a risk factor because of the double metabolic burden derived from low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and excess adiposity (obesity). The increase in obesity prevalence rates in older subjects is of concern given the associated disease risks and more limited therapeutic options available in this age group. This review has two main objectives. The primary objective is to collate results from studies investigating the effects of SO on physical and cardio-metabolic functions. The secondary objective is to evaluate published studies for consistency in methodology, diagnostic criteria, exposure and outcome selection. Large between-study heterogeneity was observed in the application of diagnostic criteria and choice of body composition components for the assessment of SO, which contributes to the inconsistent associations of SO with cardio-metabolic outcomes. We propose a metabolic load:capacity model of SO given by the ratio between fat mass and fat free mass, and discuss how this could be operationalised. The concept of regional fat distribution could be incorporated into the model and tested in future studies to advance our understanding of SO as a predictor of risk for cardio-metabolic diseases and physical disability.},

abstract = {The neural basis of memory subprocesses, encoding and retrieval, have been extensively examined in functional neuroimaging studies. However, the cortical substrates of taste memory, which form an important part of our episodic memory, have rarely been explored in humans. Previously, we have used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and found activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) related to taste encoding. The method used in the current study allowed brain monitoring while participants tasted liquid taste-stimuli in upright positions. Here, using the same system, we examined the LPFC activity of 28 healthy volunteers during both the encoding and the retrieval of taste memory. The contrast between the retrieval and eyes-closed-resting conditions revealed activation in the bilateral LPFC. This activation was significantly larger than that for encoding in the bilateral frontopolar and right dorso-LPFC regions, particularly in the right hemisphere (N=28, P {\textless} 0.05, FDR corrected), exhibiting right hemispheric dominance. Our findings are in line with the hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry (HERA) model, which proposes a process-specific prefrontal contribution to memory function. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study, we bred Hybid knock-out (KO) mice and evaluated the function of Hybid in the central nervous system. Hybid mRNA was expressed in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and cerebellum, in wild-type mice. Hybid KO mice demonstrated decreased mnemonic ability in novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. The average molecular mass of hippocampal HA increased in KO mice, accompanied by a significant increase in the total HA amount. Hybid KO mice did not differ in behavior from wild-type mice in the open field test, evaluation of acoustic startle responses, or drug-induced seizure test. In real-time PCR, Hyal1 and Hyal2 mRNA levels, which code hyaluronidases 1 and 2, respectively, did not differ between the Hybid KO and wild-type mouse brain. These results indicate that Hybid plays a key role in memory function in the brain.},

@article{Duncan_1995_8564797,
abstract = {Mechanotransduction plays a crucial role in the physiology of many tissues including bone. Mechanical loading can inhibit bone resorption and increase bone formation in vivo. In bone, the process of mechanotransduction can be divided into four distinct steps: (1) mechanocoupling, (2) biochemical coupling, (3) transmission of signal, and (4) effector cell response. In mechanocoupling, mechanical loads in vivo cause deformations in bone that stretch bone cells within and lining the bone matrix and create fluid movement within the canaliculae of bone. Dynamic loading, which is associated with extracellular fluid flow and the creation of streaming potentials within bone, is most effective for stimulating new bone formation in vivo. Bone cells in vitro are stimulated to produce second messengers when exposed to fluid flow or mechanical stretch. In biochemical coupling, the possible mechanisms for the coupling of cell-level mechanical signals into intracellular biochemical signals include force transduction through the integrin-cytoskeleton-nuclear matrix structure, stretch-activated cation channels within the cell membrane, G protein-dependent pathways, and linkage between the cytoskeleton and the phospholipase C or phospholipase A pathways. The tight interaction of each of these pathways would suggest that the entire cell is a mechanosensor and there are many different pathways available for the transduction of a mechanical signal. In the transmission of signal, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and bone lining cells may act as sensors of mechanical signals and may communicate the signal through cell processes connected by gap junctions. These cells also produce paracrine factors that may signal osteoprogenitors to differentiate into osteoblasts and attach to the bone surface. Insulin-like growth factors and prostaglandins are possible candidates for intermediaries in signal transduction. In the effector cell response, the effects of mechanical loading are dependent upon the magnitude, duration, and rate of the applied load. Longer duration, lower amplitude loading has the same effect on bone formation as loads with short duration and high amplitude. Loading must be cyclic to stimulate new bone formation. Aging greatly reduces the osteogenic effects of mechanical loading in vivo. Also, some hormones may interact with local mechanical signals to change the sensitivity of the sensor or effector cells to mechanical load.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a safe medical imaging technology, requiring no ionizing or heating radiation, as opposed to most other imaging modalities. This has led to a clinical interest in its use for long-term monitoring, possibly at the bedside, for ventilation monitoring, bleeding detection, gastric emptying and epilepsy foci diagnosis. These long-term applications demand auto-calibration and high stability over long time periods. To address this need we have developed a new multi-frequency EIT system called the KHU Mark2.5 with automatic self-calibration and cooperation with other devices via a timing signal for synchronization with other medical instruments. The impedance measurement module (IMM) for flexible configuration as a key component includes an independent constant current source, an independent differential voltmeter, and a current source calibrator, which allows automatic self-calibration of the current source within each IMM. We installed a resistor phantom inside the KHU Mark2.5 EIT system for intra-channel and inter-channel calibrations of all voltmeters in multiple IMMs. We show the deterioration of performance of an EIT system over time and the improvement due to automatic self-calibration. The system is able to maintain SNR of 80 dB for frequencies up to 250 kHz and below 0.5{\%} reciprocity error over continuous operation for 24 hours. Automatic calibration at least every 3 days is shown to maintain SNR above 75 dB and reciprocity error below 0.7{\%} over 7 days at 1 kHz. A clear degradation in performance results with increasing time between automatic calibrations allowing the tailoring of calibration to suit the performance requirements of each application.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Japan has entered the era of super-ageing and advanced health transition, which is increasingly putting pressure on the sustainability of its health system. The level and pace of this health transition might vary across regions within Japan and concern is growing about increasing regional variations in disease burden. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive, comparable framework. We used data from GBD 2015 with the aim to quantify the burden of disease and injuries, and to attribute risk factors in Japan at a subnational, prefecture-level. METHODS We used data from GBD 2015 for 315 causes and 79 risk factors of death, disease, and injury incidence and prevalence to measure the burden of diseases and injuries in Japan and in the 47 Japanese prefectures from 1990 to 2015. We extracted data from GBD 2015 to assess mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy (HALE) in Japan and its 47 prefectures. We split extracted data by prefecture and applied GBD methods to generate estimates of burden, and attributable burden due to known risk factors. We examined the prefecture-level relationships of common health system inputs (eg, health expenditure and workforces) to the GBD outputs in 2015 to address underlying determinants of regional health variations. FINDINGS Life expectancy at birth in Japan increased by 4{\textperiodcentered}2 years from 79{\textperiodcentered}0 years (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 79{\textperiodcentered}0 to 79{\textperiodcentered}0) to 83{\textperiodcentered}2 years (83{\textperiodcentered}1 to 83{\textperiodcentered}2) between 1990 and 2015. However, the gaps between prefectures with the lowest and highest life expectancies and HALE have widened, from 2{\textperiodcentered}5 to 3{\textperiodcentered}1 years and from 2{\textperiodcentered}3 to 2{\textperiodcentered}7 years, respectively, from 1990 to 2015. Although overall age-standardised death rates decreased by 29{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (28{\textperiodcentered}7 to 29{\textperiodcentered}3) from 1990 to 2015, the rates of mortality decline in this period substantially varied across the prefectures, ranging from -32{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (-34{\textperiodcentered}8 to -30{\textperiodcentered}0) to -22{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (-20{\textperiodcentered}4 to -20{\textperiodcentered}1). During the same time period, the rate of age-standardised DALYs was reduced overall by 19{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}9 to 22{\textperiodcentered}0). The reduction in rates of age-standardised YLDs was very small by 3{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (2{\textperiodcentered}6 to 4{\textperiodcentered}3). The pace of reduction in mortality and DALYs in many leading causes has largely levelled off since 2005. Known risk factors accounted for 34{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (32{\textperiodcentered}4 to 36{\textperiodcentered}9) of DALYs; the two leading behavioural risk factors were unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking in 2015. The common health system inputs were not associated with age-standardised death and DALY rates in 2015. INTERPRETATION Japan has been successful overall in reducing mortality and disability from most major diseases. However, progress has slowed down and health variations between prefectures is growing.

abstract = {Diabetes is associated with increased fracture risk, involving a variety of factors. Besides poor glycemic control itself, some glucose-lowering agents are also associated with increased fracture risk. Thiazolidinediones increase fracture risk probably through inhibition of bone formation as well as increased resorption leading to decreased BMD. Sodium-glucose cotransporter(SGLT)-2 inhibitors have been reported to decrease BMD and increase fracture risk. However, the class effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on bone metabolism remains to be established. In diabetic patients, especially in those with high fracture risk such as postmenopausal women, careful selection of glucose-lowering agents as well as appropriate and timely intervention for osteoporosis is necessary.},

abstract = {Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and $\beta$3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) genes play central roles in the thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans. However, the importance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both genes during the development of obesity is controversial. Although active BAT in adult humans is frequently observed in the winter season, the effects of sampling season have not been taken into consideration in previous association studies. Here, we tested the associations of UCP1 -3826A/G and ADRB3 Trp64Arg with body mass index (BMI) and visceral fat area (VFA) in 3013 Japanese adults sampled during different seasons. Association between SNPs and the obesity-related traits were assessed using multiple linear regression models, including sex, age, physical activity, and genotypes. Both SNPs did not show significant associations in the models based on the entire cohort. However, in subsets comprising individuals mainly sampled from winter to spring, UCP1 showed significant associations with VFA (P = 0.0098) and VFA adjusted for BMI (P = 0.0128). Moreover, the effects of UCP1 on VFA were strongly negatively correlated with outdoor temperature (P = 0.00011), but not with night length (P = 0.039). ADRB3 did not show these associations, but an additive effect with UCP1 was observed for VFA adjusted for BMI (P = 0.0067). Subsets sampled in the hot season did not show significant associations for both SNPs. The season-specific effects of UCP1 on VFA were consistent with a previous finding that active BAT was more frequently found in winter than in summer, and supported the importance of cold stress in BAT activation and the significance of BAT in the development of obesity in adult humans.},

abstract = {Interpretation and estimation of vaccine efficacy is complicated when the vaccine effect is heterogeneous across vaccinated strata. If a person has a certain susceptibility, or probability of becoming infected conditional on a specified exposure to infection, then one effect of a vaccine would be to reduce that susceptibility, possibly to zero. Vaccine efficacy is a function of the relative susceptibilities in the vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Under heterogeneity of vaccine effect, a general expression for a summary vaccine efficacy parameter is a function of the vaccine efficacy in the different vaccinated strata weighted by the fraction of the vaccinated subpopulations in each stratum. Interpretation and estimability of the summary vaccine efficacy parameter depends on whether the strata are identifiable, and whether the heterogeneity is host- or vaccine-related. Bounds are derived for the summary vaccine efficacy when the strata are not identifiable for the case of an outbreak of an acute infectious disease. The upper bound assumes that everyone is equally affected by the vaccine, and the lower bound assumes that some are completely protected while others have no protection. The biologic interpretation of the two bounds is different.},

abstract = {The association of bone with the metabolic syndrome and its features, visceral fat accumulation or insulin resistance, remains unclear. We determined visceral and subcutaneous fat areas (V and S) by computed tomography on 187 men (28-83 years) and 125 postmenopausal women (46-82 years) with type 2 diabetes. Men whose V was 100 cm(2) or more had significantly lower urinary N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (p=0.005), higher femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) (p=0.004), and lower prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) (p=0.04) than controls. Fat mass, V, S, and lean body mass positively correlated with FN-BMD in men and with lumbar (L) and FN-BMD in women. When adjusted for weight, these correlations became negative. Urinary C-peptide positively correlated with FN-BMD in both genders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, height, weight, L-BMD, duration of diabetes, and diabetes therapies identified V in men and urinary C-peptide in women as factors inversely associated with the presence of VFs [odds ratio (OR)=0.61 per SD increase, p=0.04, and OR=0.32, p=0.01, respectively]. These findings suggest that, of the components of the metabolic syndrome, body fat in gravity and hyperinsulinemia could increase FN-BMD in diabetic subjects. Visceral fat in men and hyperinsulinemia in women may protect against VFs independent of weight, L-BMD, diabetes duration, or therapies.},

It first reconstructs the skeleton of a Bayesian network and then performs a Bayesian-scoring greedy hill-climbing search to orient the edges.

These are the first empirical re- sults simultaneously comparing most of the major Bayesian network algorithms against each other. MMHC offers certain theoretical advantages, specifically over the Sparse Candidate algorithm, corroborated by our experiments.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The causal effect of adipose tissue on bone mass and the direction of its net influence have not been directly assessed in adult humans. Using the Mendelian randomization analysis, we assessed the causality of adiposity in measurements of bone mass in adult males and females. DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects consisted of 2154 adults aged 25-54 years from a cross-sectional cohort of the employees of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. Body composition was determined after at least 3 h of fasting using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. A polymorphism in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO rs9939609) was used as an instrument in the Mendelian randomization analysis. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was 61.1{\%} TT, 33.9{\%} AT and 5.0{\%} AA. The average body mass index (BMI), body fat mass and percentage body fat were 23.9 kg/m(2) (SD = 3.6), 17.9 kg (SD = 6.6) and 26.8{\%} (SD = 7.2), respectively. The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was significantly correlated with BMI (coefficient = 0.673 kg/m(2) , P {\textless} 0.001), body fat mass (coefficient = 0.948 kg, P {\textless} 0.001) and percentage body fat (coefficient = 0.759{\%}, P {\textless} 0.01). An instrumental variable (IV) regression model, using BMI as the intermediate phenotype, suggested that FTO was a strong IV. Also, the FTO-BMI polymorphism was significantly associated with total hip and femoral neck BMD but was not correlated with total spine BMD, with estimated correlation coefficients of 0.0189 (95{\%} CI: 0.0046, 0.0332), 0.0149 (95{\%} CI: 0.0030, 0.0268) and 0.0025 (95{\%} CI: -0.0131, 0.0136) g/cm(2) , respectively. The variances of BMDs explained by the FTO-BMI were 19.0{\%}, 21.3{\%} and 1.1{\%}, respectively. Similar trends were also observed for the FTO-body fat mass and FTO-percentage body fat correlations. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analysis suggests that adiposity might be causally related to BMD at the femur but not at the spine.},

The estimation procedure is found to be quite robust for parameter values preset within appropriate limits for influenza. However, a significant difference is found between the preset and estimated household contact parameter for epidemics of medium and high intensity when the preset value is zero. Incremental increases in the household contact parameter are shown to produce marked increases in the overall infection attack rate demonstrating that household spread is an important link in maintaining infection in other mixing groups such as schools, preschool groups and neighbourhood clusters of households.},

We assessed the effect of DAG versus triacylglycerol (TAG) treatment on total energy expenditure (TEE), total fat oxidation (Fox) and respiratory quotient (RQ), and measured the oxidation rate of each oil using a respiratory chamber and the 13C-stable isotope. Eleven healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study. Subjects consumed an energy maintenance diet consisting of 55{\%} of total calories from carbohydrate, 15{\%} from protein and 30{\%} from fat during both the 3-day pre-chamber and 36-h chamber period. Fifty percent of the fat was test oil, containing either DAG oil or TAG oil. The oxidation rate of ingested test oils was determined by monitoring 13CO2 excretion in the breath from 13C-labeled diolein or 13C-labeled triolein. There were no significant differences in TEE, RQ and total Fox between the DAG and TAG treatment in the overall analysis. In the subgroup analysis, DAG treatment decreased RQ significantly in subjects with a high fat ratio (HFR) compared to TAG treatment. In addition, ingested diolein oxidation in DAG treatment was significantly faster than triolein oxidation in TAG treatment in the HFR group. Enhanced fat utilization with DAG treatment and rapid oxidation of ingested DAG may, at least in part, explain the greater loss of body weight and body fat related to DAG consumption found in the weight-loss studies.},

abstract = {The motivation to eat in humans is a complex process influenced by intrinsic mechanisms relating to the hunger and satiety cascade, and extrinsic mechanisms based on the appetitive incentive value of individual foods, which can themselves induce desire. This study was designed to investigate the neural basis of these two factors contributing to the control of motivation to eat within the same experimental design using positron emission tomography. Using a novel counterbalanced approach, participants were scanned in two separate sessions, once after fasting and once after food intake, in which they imagined themselves in a restaurant and considered a number of items on a menu, and were asked to choose their most preferred. All items were tailored to each individual and varied in their incentive value. No actual foods were presented. In response to a hungry state, increased activation was shown in the hypothalamus, amygdala and insula cortex as predicted, as well as the medulla, striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. Satiety, in contrast, was associated with increased activation in the lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex. Only activity in the vicinity of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex was observed in response to the processing of extrinsic appetitive incentive information. These results suggest that the contributions of intrinsic homeostatic influences, and extrinsic incentive factors to the motivation to eat, are somewhat dissociable neurally, with areas of convergence in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. The findings of this study have implications for research into the underlying mechanisms of eating disorders.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for estimating lung density, air volume and changes in fluid content from a non-invasive measurement of the electrical resistivity of the lungs. Resistivity in $\Omega$ m was found by fitting measured electrical impedance tomography (EIT) data to a finite difference model of the thorax. Lung density was determined by comparing the resistivity of the lungs, measured at a relatively high frequency, with values predicted from a published model of lung structure. Lung air volume can then be calculated if total lung weight is also known. Temporal changes in lung fluid content will produce proportional changes in lung density. The method was implemented on EIT data, collected using eight electrodes placed in a single plane around the thorax, from 46 adult male subjects and 36 adult female subjects. Mean lung densities (±SD) of 246 ± 67 and 239 ± 64 kg m(-3), respectively, were obtained. In seven adult male subjects estimates of 1.68 ± 0.30, 3.42 ± 0.49 and 4.40 ± 0.53 l in residual volume, functional residual capacity and vital capacity, respectively, were obtained. Sources of error are discussed. It is concluded that absolute differences in lung density of about 30{\%} and changes over time of less than 30{\%} should be detected using the current technology in normal subjects. These changes would result from approximately 300 ml increase in lung fluid. The method proposed could be used for non-invasive monitoring of total lung air and fluid content in normal subjects but needs to be assessed in patients with lung disease.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies indicate that habitual coffee consumption lowers the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Postprandial hyperglycemia is a direct and independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We previously demonstrated that coffee polyphenol ingestion increased secretion of Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which has been shown to exhibit anti-diabetic and cardiovascular effects. We hypothesized coffee polyphenol consumption may improve postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular endothelial function by increasing GLP-1 release and/or reducing oxidative stress. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a randomized, acute, crossover, intervention study in healthy male adults, measuring blood parameters and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) after ingestion of a meal with or without coffee polyphenol extract (CPE). Nineteen subjects consumed a test meal with either a placebo- or CPE-containing beverage. Blood biomarkers and FMD were measured at fasting and up to 180 minutes postprandially. The CPE beverage led to a significantly lower peak postprandial increase in blood glucose and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolite, and significantly higher postprandial FMD than the placebo beverage. Postprandial blood GLP-1 increase tended to be higher after ingestion of the CPE beverage, compared with placebo. Subclass analysis revealed that the CPE beverage significantly improved postprandial blood GLP-1 response and reduced blood glucose increase in the subjects with a lower insulinogenic index. Correlation analysis showed postprandial FMD was negatively associated with blood glucose increase after ingestion of the CPE beverage. In conclusion, these results suggest that coffee polyphenol consumption improves postprandial hyperglycemia and vascular endothelial function, which is associated with increased GLP-1 secretion and decreased oxidative stress in healthy humans.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To verify the influence of visceral and subcutaneous fat, as well adipokines in bone mineral density (BMD) in obese adolescents. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study involved 125 postpubertal obese adolescents (45 boys and 80 girls). Anthropometric measurements, body composition, visceral and subcutaneous fat, and BMD were determined. Leptin, adiponectin, and insulin levels also analyzed. RESULTS: Data demonstrated a negative relationship between BMD with insulin resistance, visceral fat and leptin concentration; and bone mineral content with visceral/subcutaneous ratio. Positive association between BMD and subcutaneous fat was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Visceral fat and insulin resistance, as well as visceral/subcutaneous ratio and leptin concentration, were negative predictors of BMD in boys and girls, respectively. However, subcutaneous fat had a protective influence in BMD only in boys.},

abstract = {Individual-based epidemiology models are increasingly used in the study of influenza epidemics. Several studies on influenza dynamics and evaluation of intervention measures have used the same incubation and infectious period distribution parameters based on the natural history of influenza. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the influence of slight changes to these parameters (in addition to the transmissibility) would be useful for future studies and real-time modeling during an influenza pandemic.In this study, we examined individual and joint effects of parameters and ranked parameters based on their influence on the dynamics of simulated epidemics. We also compared the sensitivity of the model across synthetic social networks for Montgomery County in Virginia and New York City (and surrounding metropolitan regions) with demographic and rural-urban differences. In addition, we studied the effects of changing the mean infectious period on age-specific epidemics. The research was performed from a public health standpoint using three relevant measures: time to peak, peak infected proportion and total attack rate. We also used statistical methods in the design and analysis of the experiments. The results showed that: (i) minute changes in the transmissibility and mean infectious period significantly influenced the attack rate; (ii) the mean of the incubation period distribution appeared to be sufficient for determining its effects on the dynamics of epidemics; (iii) the infectious period distribution had the strongest influence on the structure of the epidemic curves; (iv) the sensitivity of the individual-based model was consistent across social networks investigated in this study and (v) age-specific epidemics were sensitive to changes in the mean infectious period irrespective of the susceptibility of the other age groups. These findings suggest that small changes in some of the disease model parameters can significantly influence the uncertainty observed in real-time forecasting and predicting of the characteristics of an epidemic.},

abstract = {Objectives: Serum ferritin increases in various disorders and clinical conditions. However, causal associations between the serum ferritin level and clinical factors that influence serum ferritin level are not well characterized. We report a model that quantitatively analyzes the causal relations between the serum ferritin level and clinical factors. Design and methods: We analyzed the ferritin level and other laboratory data in the sera of 274 patients. Structural equation modeling was used to verify causal relations and the adequacy of latent factors. Results: Three factors representing clinical status were identified: cell damage, hepatic function, and inflammation. Serum iron (SI) had the strongest effect on serum ferritin elevation. The effect of the cell damage factor on serum ferritin indicated cell destruction, and that of the hepatic function factor represented decreased serum ferritin clearance. The cell damage factor also indirectly increased the ferritin level via SI or the hepatic function factor. The total effect of the inflammatory status factor on ferritin level was very weak. Conclusions: These causal relations may explain the mechanism of serum ferritin level elevation in various clinical conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Green tea(GT) is able to increase energy expenditure(EE) and fat oxidation(FATox) via inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase(COMT) by catechins. However, this does not always appear unanimously because of large inter-individual variability. This may be explained by different alleles of the functional COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism that are associated with COMT enzyme activity; high-activity enzyme, COMT(H)(Val/Val genotype), and low-activity COMT(L)(Met/Met genotype). METHODS: Fourteen Caucasian subjects (BMI: 22.2±2.3 kg/m2, age: 21.4±2.2 years) of whom 7 with the COMT(H)-genotype and 7 with the COMT(L)-genotype were included in a randomized, cross-over study in which EE and substrate oxidation were measured with a ventilated-hood system after decaffeinated GT and placebo(PL) consumption. RESULTS: At baseline, EE, RQ, FATox and carbohydrate oxidation(CHOox) did not differ between groups. Significant interactions were observed between COMT genotypes and treatment for RQ, FATox and CHOox (p{\textless}0.05). After GT vs. PL, EE(GT: 62.2 vs. PL: 35.4 kJ.3.5 hrs; p{\textless}0.01), RQ(GT: 0.80 vs. PL: 0.83; p{\textless}0.01), FATox(GT: 18.3 vs. PL: 15.3 g/d; p{\textless}0.001) and CHOox(GT: 18.5 vs. PL: 24.3 g/d; p{\textless}0.001) were significantly different for subjects carrying the COMT(H) genotype, but not for subjects carrying the COMT(L) genotype (EE, GT: 60.3 vs. PL: 51.7 kJ.3.5 hrs; NS), (RQ, GT: 0.81 vs. PL: 0.81; NS), (FATox, GT: 17.3 vs. PL: 17.0 g/d; NS), (CHOox, GT: 22.1 vs. PL: 21.4 g/d; NS). CONCLUSION: Subjects carrying the COMT(H) genotype increased energy expenditure and fat-oxidation upon ingestion of green tea catechins vs, placebo, whereas COMT(L) genotype carriers reacted similarly to GT and PL ingestion. The differences in responses were due to the different responses on PL ingestion, but similar responses to GT ingestion, pointing to different mechanisms. The different alleles of the functional COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism appear to play a role in the inter-individual variability for EE and FATox after GT treatment.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s) Exposure assessment is a fundamental part of the risk assessment paradigm, but can often present a number of challenges and uncertainties. This is especially the case for process contaminants formed during the processing, e.g. heating of food, since they are in part highly reactive and/or volatile, thus making exposure assessment by analysing contents in food unreliable. New approaches are therefore required to accurately assess consumer exposure and thus better inform the risk assessment. Such novel approaches may include the use of biomarkers, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling-facilitated reverse dosimetry, and/or duplicate diet studies. This review focuses on the state of the art with respect to the use of biomarkers of exposure for the process contaminants acrylamide, 3-MCPD esters, glycidyl esters, furan and acrolein. From the overview presented, it becomes clear that the field of assessing human exposure to process-related contaminants in food by biomarker monitoring is promising and strongly developing. The current state of the art as well as the existing data gaps and challenges for the future were defined. They include (1) using PBK modelling and duplicate diet studies to establish, preferably in humans, correlations between external exposure and biomarkers; (2) elucidation of the possible endogenous formation of the process-related contaminants and the resulting biomarker levels; (3) the influence of inter-individual variations and how to include that in the biomarker-based exposure predictions; (4) the correction for confounding factors; (5) the value of the different biomarkers in relation to exposure scenario's and risk assessment, and (6) the possibilities of novel methodologies. In spite of these challenges it can be concluded that biomarker-based exposure assessment provides a unique opportunity to more accurately assess consumer exposure to process-related contaminants in food and thus to better inform risk assessment.},

abstract = {Regularization algorithms are often used to produce reasonable solutions to ill-posed problems. The L-curve is a plot—for all valid regularization parameters—of the size of the regularized solution versus the size of the corresponding residual. Two main results are established. First a unifying characterization of various regularization methods is given and it is shown that the measurement of “size” is dependent on the particular regularization method chosen. For example, the 2-norm is appropriate for Tikhonov regularization, but a 1-norm in the coordinate system of the singular value decomposition (SVD) is relevant to truncated SVD regularization. Second, a new method is proposed for choosing the regularization parameter based on the L-curve, and it is shown how this method can be implemented efficiently. The method is compared to generalized cross validation and this new method is shown to be more robust in the presence of correlated errors.},

abstract = {Use of the final size distribution of minor outbreaks for the estimation of the reproduction numbers of supercritical epidemic processes has yet to be considered. We used a branching process model to derive the final size distribution of minor outbreaks, assuming a reproduction number above unity, and applying the method to final size data for pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a spatially limited setting. Because the final size distribution of a minor outbreak needs to be normalized by the probability of extinction, we assume that the dispersion parameter (k) of the negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k=1, the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.97-1.38). When less dispersed with k=2, the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number was 1.14. These estimates agreed with those published from transmission network analysis, indicating that the human-to-human transmission potential of the pneumonic plague is not very high. Given only minor outbreaks, transmission potential is not sufficiently assessed by directly counting the number of offspring. Since the absence of a major epidemic does not guarantee a subcritical process, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard epidemic data from minor outbreaks as supercritical, and yield estimates of threshold values above unity. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

In designing a study to evaluate vaccination, the type of effect and the question of interest determine the appropriate choice of comparison population and parameter. Possible questions of interest include that of the biologic effect of vaccination on susceptibility, on infectiousness, or on progression to disease in individuals. The indirect effects, total effects, and overall public health benefits of widespread vaccination of individuals within the context of a vaccination program might also be of primary concern. The change in behavior induced by belief in the protective effects of vaccination might influence the estimates of these effects or might itself be of interest. In this paper, the authors present a framework of study designs that relates the scientific question of interest to the choice of comparison groups, the unit of observation, the level of information available for analysis, and the parameter of effect.},

abstract = {Background . The main criticism of the definition of “osteosarcopenic obesity” (OSO) is the lack of division between subcutaneous and visceral fat. This study describes the prevalence, metabolic profile, and risk factors of two new phenotypes of sarcopenia: osteosarcopenic visceral obesity (OSVAT) and osteosarcopenic subcutaneous obesity (OSSAT). Methods . A standardized geriatric assessment was performed by anthropometric and biochemical measures. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to assess body composition, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), osteoporosis, and sarcopenia. Results . A sample of 801 subjects were assessed (247 men; 554 women). The prevalence of osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO) was 6.79{\%}; OSSAT and OSOVAT were, respectively, 2.22{\%} and 4.56{\%}. OSVAT (versus the others) showed a higher level of inflammation (CRP and ESR, p {\textless} 0.05 ), bilirubin ( p {\textless} 0.05 ), and risk of fractures (FRAX index over 15{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001 ). Subjects with OSSAT did not show any significant risk factors associated to obesity. Conclusions . The osteosarcopenic visceral obesity phenotype (OSVAT) seems to be associated with a higher risk of fractures, inflammation, and a worse metabolic profile. These conditions in OSVAT cohort are associated with an increase of visceral adipose tissue, while patients with OSSAT seem to benefit related to the “obesity paradox.”},

abstract = {Automated organ segmentation from medical images is an indispensable component for clinical applications such as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and computer-assisted surgery (CAS). We utilize a multi-atlas segmentation scheme, which has recently been used in different approaches in the literature to achieve more accurate and robust segmentation of anatomical structures in computed tomography (CT) volume data. Among abdominal organs, the pancreas has large inter-patient variability in its position, size and shape. Moreover, the CT intensity of the pancreas closely resembles adjacent tissues, rendering its segmentation a challenging task. Due to this, conventional intensity-based atlas selection for pancreas segmentation often fails to select atlases that are similar in pancreas position and shape to those of the unlabeled target volume. In this paper, we propose a new atlas selection strategy based on vessel structure around the pancreatic tissue and demonstrate its application to a multi-atlas pancreas segmentation. Our method utilizes vessel structure around the pancreas to select atlases with high pancreatic resemblance to the unlabeled volume. Also, we investigate two types of applications of the vessel structure information to the atlas selection. Our segmentations were evaluated on 150 abdominal contrast-enhanced CT volumes. The experimental results showed that our approach can segment the pancreas with an average Jaccard index of 66.3{\%} and an average Dice overlap coefficient of 78.5{\%}.},

It is necessary to solve an inverse problem to estimate the cortical dipole distribution from the scalp potentials. In the present study, the accuracy of cortical dipole imaging was improved by focusing on filtering property of the spatial inverse filter. We proposed an inverse filter that optimizes filtering property using a sigmoid function. The ability of the proposed method was compared with the traditional inverse techniques, such as Tikhonov regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), and truncated total least squares (TTLS), in a computer simulation. The proposed method was applied to human experimental data of visual evoked potentials. As a result, the estimation accuracy was improved and the localized dipole distribution was obtained with less noise.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Medical masks are commonly used by sick individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) to prevent spread of infections to others, but clinical efficacy data are absent. OBJECTIVE Determine whether medical mask use by sick individuals with ILI protects well contacts from related respiratory infections. SETTING 6 major hospitals in 2 districts of Beijing, China. DESIGN Cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS 245 index cases with ILI. INTERVENTION Index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) and control arms (n=122). Since 43 index cases in the control arm also used a mask during the study period, an as-treated post hoc analysis was performed by comparing outcomes among household members of index cases who used a mask (mask group) with household members of index cases who did not use a mask (no-mask group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Primary outcomes measured in household members were clinical respiratory illness, ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection. RESULTS In an intention-to-treat analysis, rates of clinical respiratory illness (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95{\%} CI 0.18 to 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95{\%} CI 0.03 to 3.13) and laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95{\%} CI 0.06 to 15.54) were consistently lower in the mask arm compared with control, although not statistically significant. A post hoc comparison between the mask versus no-mask groups showed a protective effect against clinical respiratory illness, but not against ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS The study indicates a potential benefit of medical masks for source control, but is limited by small sample size and low secondary attack rates. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy of medical masks as source control. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER ACTRN12613000852752; Results.},

Recent results suggest that the use of spectral constraints can significantly improve image quality. We present a combined reconstruction-classification method for estimating the spectra of individual tissues, whilst simultaneously reconstructing the conductivity. The advantage of this method is that a priori knowledge of the spectra is not required to be exact in that the constraints are updated at each step of the reconstruction. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the proposed method to errors in the initial guess of the tissue spectra, and look at the effect of introducing spatial smoothing. We formalize and validate a frequency-difference variant of reconstruction-classification, and compare the use of absolute and frequency-difference data in the case of a phantom experiment.},

METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and summarize the findings of these studies. We identified 27 articles, around half of which reported studies conducted in May and June 2009. RESULTS In 13 of the 27 studies (48{\%}) that collected respiratory specimens from household contacts, point estimates of the risk of secondary infection ranged from 3{\%} to 38{\%}, with substantial heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses revealed that a part of the heterogeneity reflected varying case ascertainment and study designs. The estimates of symptomatic secondary infection risk, based on 20 studies identifying febrile acute respiratory illness among household contacts, also showed substantial variability, with point estimates ranging from 4{\%} to 37{\%}. CONCLUSIONS Transmission of the 2009 pandemic virus in households appeared to vary among countries and settings, with differences in estimates of the secondary infection risk also partly due to differences in study designs.},

In this review, we look at some of the best-characterised functions that only the gut microbiota plays and how it interacts with the host's endocrine system and we try to make it clear that the 21st-century biology cannot afford to ignore this facet of biology, if it wants to fully understand what makes us human.},

Causality inference in nutritional epidemiology is largely based on evidence from studies of observational design, and may be distorted by unmeasured or residual confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization is a recently developed methodology that combines genetic and classical epidemiological analysis to infer causality for environmental exposures, based on the principle of Mendel's law of independent assortment. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures of interest. Associations derived from Mendelian randomization analysis are less likely to be affected by confounding and reverse causation. During the past 5 years, a body of studies examined the causal effects of diet/lifestyle factors and biomarkers on a variety of diseases. The Mendelian randomization approach also holds considerable promise in the study of intrauterine influences on offspring health outcomes. However, the application of Mendelian randomization in nutritional epidemiology has some limitations.},

abstract = {Osteopenia/osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and obesity are commonly observed in the process of aging, and recent evidence suggests a potential interconnection of these syndromes with common pathophysiology. The term osteosarcopenic obesity has been coined to describe the concurrent appearance of obesity in individuals with low bone and muscle mass. Although our understanding of osteosarcopenic obesity's etiology, prevalence, and consequences is extremely limited, it is reasonable to infer its negative impact in a population that is aging in an obesogenic environment. It is likely that these individuals will present with poorer clinical outcomes caused by the cascade of metabolic abnormalities associated with these changes in body composition. Clinical outcomes include but are not limited to increased risk of fractures, impaired functional status (including activities of daily living), physical disability, insulin resistance, increased risk of infections, increased length of hospital stay, and reduced survival. These health outcomes are likely to be worse when compared to individuals with obesity, sarcopenia, or osteopenia/osteoporosis alone. Interventions that utilize resistance training exercise in conjunction with increased protein intake appear to be promising in their ability to counteract osteosarcopenic obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Sedentary behaviors have recently become an important public health issue. We aimed to investigate the relationship between screen time and nutrient intake in children and adolescents. METHODS The present study was conducted in 2013. Data were collected from children and adolescents aged between 6 and 15 years old in Shika town. Questionnaires were distributed to 1459 subjects, 1414 of whom participated in the study (96.9{\%}). Sedentary behaviors were assessed based on participants' screen behaviors (television (TV) viewing, personal computer (PC) use, and mobile phone (MP) use). The main outcomes were the intake of nutrients from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the significance of differences in nutrient intake estimates. Multivariate linear regression analyses, adjusting for age, BMI, and physical activity, were used to provide parameter estimates ($\beta$) and 95{\%} CI for the relationship between screen time and nutrient intake. RESULTS In boys, longer TV viewing times correlated or tended to correlate with a lower intake of protein, potassium, calcium, iron, vitamin K, vitamin B-2, and total dietary fiber. In girls, longer TV viewing times correlated with a lower intake of protein, sodium, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B-2. Longer TV viewing times correlated with a higher intake of n-6 fatty acids in girls. PC use was related or tended to be related to a lower intake of potassium, iron, vitamin K, and folic acid in boys, but not in girls. A relationship was observed between MP use and a lower intake of vitamin K in boys, and MP use and a higher intake of vitamin D in girls. CONCLUSIONS The present results revealed that longer TV viewing times are associated with less protein, minerals, vitamins, and total dietary fiber intake in children and adolescents. It was also revealed that boys with PC use have less minerals and vitamins. These results support the need to design intervention programs that focus on decreasing TV viewing time in both sexes and PC use in boys while encouraging adherence to dietary guidelines among children and adolescents.},

abstract = {The importance of the circadian rhythm in regulating human food intake behaviour and metabolism has long been recognised. However, little is known as to how energy intake is distributed over the day in existing populations, and its potential association with obesity. The present review describes global trends in time-of-day of energy intake in the general population based on data from cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal cohorts. Evidence of the association between time-of-day of energy intake and obesity is also summarised. Overall, there were a limited number of cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal cohorts that provided data on time-of-day of energy intake. In the identified studies, a wide variation in time-of-day of energy intake was observed, with patterns of energy distribution varying greatly by country and geographical area. In relation to obesity, eight cross-sectional surveys and two longitudinal cohorts were identified. The association between time-of-day of energy intake and obesity varied widely, with several studies reporting a positive link between evening energy intake and obesity. In conclusion, the current review summarises global trends in time-of-day of energy intake. The large variations across countries and global regions could have important implications to health, emphasising the need to understand the socio-environmental factors guiding such differences in eating patterns. Evidence of the association between time-of-day of energy intake and BMI also varied. Further larger scale collaborations between various countries and regions are needed to sum data from existing surveys and cohorts, and guide our understanding of the role of chrono-nutrition in health.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Decline in the number of teeth and physical fitness begins from 40 years of age; however, several epidemiological studies have identified relationships between oral conditions and physical performance parameters in community-dwelling elderly population. The aim of this study was to validate the relationship between the muscle mass and its function and oral conditions (number of teeth and dental occlusion) after 40 years of age in a community-dwelling population in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS The subjects comprised of 552 volunteers (198 males and 354 females, 40-79 years) who participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in 2013. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed with the measures of the muscle mass and its function as objective variables and the measures of the number of teeth, age, body mass index, medical history, serum albumin concentration, smoking status, habitual alcohol intake, marital status, education levels, and exercising habits as explanatory variables. The relationships between the Eichner index and the muscle mass and its function were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS After adjusting for confounding factors, the number of teeth was shown to be an independent risk factor for the timed 10 m walk test (in females) and the skeletal muscle mass of the whole body (in males). The results also revealed that the timed 10 m walk test was significantly correlated with the Eichner index (Classes A and C in females were correlated). CONCLUSION This cross-sectional study on a Japanese community-dwelling population revealed relationships between oral conditions and the muscle mass and its function. However, the interpretation of our results was hampered by a lack of data, including those on socioeconomic status and longitudinal observations. Future research exploring teeth loss and the muscle mass and its function is warranted.},

abstract = {AIMS Sarcopenia measured as appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and central obesity measured as visceral fat area (VFA) may act synergistically to influence metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. However, several previous studies reported that metabolic risk is higher in non-sarcopenic obesity groups than in sarcopenic obesity groups because of the close relationship between muscle mass and body fat. We investigated the association of the ASM to VFA ratio, which we have termed the muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR), with metabolic syndrome and arterial stiffness. METHODS This study was performed in 526 apparently healthy adults enrolled in the Korean Sarcopenic Obesity Study, an ongoing prospective observational cohort study. ASM was evaluated with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and VFA with computed tomography. Arterial stiffness was measured using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). RESULTS MFR was significantly associated with waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profiles, glucose and baPWV. By multiple logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for metabolic syndrome was 5.43 (lowest versus highest tertile of MFR, 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.56-13.34). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that MFR was an independent determinant of baPWV (R²=0.57).

abstract = {The metabolic syndrome is a set of risk factors that include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It has affected around 25{\%} of adults in the US and become a serious problem in Asian countries recently due to the change in dietary habit and life style. On the other hand, Bayesian networks that are the models to solve the problems of uncertainty provide a robust and transparent formalism for probabilistic modeling, so they have been used as a method for diagnostic or prognostic model in medical domain. Since the K2 algorithm, a well-known algorithm for Bayesian networks structure learning, is influenced by an input order of the attributes, an optimization of BN attribute ordering has been studied as a research issue. This paper proposes a novel ordering optimization method using a genetic algorithm based on medical expert knowledge in order to solve this problem. For experiments, we use the dataset examined twice in 1993 and 1995 in Yonchon County of Korea. It has 18 attributes of 1193 subjects participated in both surveys. Using this dataset, we make the prognostic model of the metabolic syndrome using Bayesian networks with an optimized ordering by evolutionary approach. Through an ordering optimization, the prognostic model of higher performance is constructed, and the optimized Bayesian network model by the proposed method outperforms the conventional BN model as well as neural networks and k-nearest neighbors. Finally, we present the application program using the prognostic model of the metabolic syndrome in order to show the usefulness of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The act of tasting is the product of inseparable integrative behavior consisting of multi-sensory processing and orolingual motor coordination. Often tasting-induced brain activity is looked at in a reductionist manner as a set of isolated components. However, brain activity as a whole during tasting may not simply be the sum of isolated brain responses; therefore, attempting to look at the cortical activation in a more holistic manner is important. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we assessed cortical responses during tasting, contrasting observed neuronal activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), of 19 healthy participants before and during tasting of 8 ml of sweet-based solutions. To examine the activated brain structure, we estimated the anatomical regions of the measured location in standard brain space. We also included simple tongue tapping movement (TT) and word fluency (WF) tasks as comparative functional markers. Significant activity was found in channels (CHs) estimated to be in the bilateral oral motor areas during the TT task, and those in the LPFC, primarily in the left hemisphere, during the WF task. During the tasting task, significant activation was observed in CHs estimated to lie in the ventral part of pre- and post-central gyri as well as in the ventro-LPFC (VLPFC). The activated regions partly overlapped with those detected during TT or WF tasks, but extended more anteriorly and ventrally. Our study suggests that, in addition to tongue motor areas, the VLPFC is involved in the act of tasting. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a member of an emerging CCN gene family that is implicated in various diseases associated with fibro-proliferative disorder including scleroderma and atherosclerosis. The function of CTGF in human cancer is largely unknown. We now show that CTGF induces apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. CTGF mRNA was completely absent in MCF-7 but strongly induced by treatment with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta by itself induced apoptosis in MCF-7, and this effect was reversed by co-treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide. Overexpression of CTGF gene in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells significantly augmented apoptosis. Moreover, recombinant CTGF protein significantly enhanced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as evaluated by DNA fragmentation, Tdt-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling staining, flow cytometry analysis, and nuclear staining using Hoechst 33258. Finally, recombinant CTGF showed no effect on Bax protein expression but significantly reduced Bcl2 protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that CTGF is a major inducer of apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and that TGF-beta-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is mediated, in part, by CTGF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fat mass is thought to be protective against osteoporosis, primarily because of its weight-bearing effect. Few studies have evaluated the association between abdominal fat mass (AFM) and bone health beyond its weight-bearing effect. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that higher body weight-adjusted AFM is associated with poor bone health. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 629 Puerto Rican adults aged 47-79 y. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck, trochanter, total femur, and lumbar spine (L2-L4) were measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). AFM and total fat mass (TFM) were assessed by using body-composition software from whole-body DXA scans. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined as T-scores {\textless}/= -2.5 and -1.0 to -2.5 SD, respectively, at the respective bone site. RESULTS: After confounders were controlled for, body weight-adjusted AFM was inversely associated with BMD at all 4 bone sites in women and at the femoral neck in men. For TFM, small inverse associations were seen at the trochanter and total femur in women. In men, similar associations were seen at the 3 femur sites. In both sexes, the odds for osteoporosis or osteopenia at each of the femoral sites increased by 10-16{\%} for every 100-g increase in body weight-adjusted AFM. CONCLUSIONS: Higher AFM was associated with poor bone health in this Puerto Rican sample. Efforts to reduce abdominal obesity will not only reduce the risk of chronic disease but may also improve bone health. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01231958.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There is a recognized need to determine influenza vaccine effectiveness on an annual basis and a long history of studying respiratory illnesses in households. METHODS We recruited 328 households with 1441 members, including 839 children, and followed them during the 2010-2011 influenza season. Specimens were collected from subjects with reported acute respiratory illnesses and tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receipt of influenza vaccine was defined based on documented evidence of vaccination in medical records or an immunization registry. The effectiveness of 2010-2011 influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and presence of high-risk condition, and stratified by prior season (2009-2010) vaccination status. RESULTS Influenza was identified in 78 (24{\%}) households and 125 (9{\%}) individuals; the infection risk was 8.5{\%} in the vaccinated and 8.9{\%} in the unvaccinated (P = .83). Adjusted vaccine effectiveness in preventing community-acquired influenza was 31{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -7{\%} to 55{\%}). In vaccinated subjects with no evidence of prior season vaccination, significant protection (62{\%} [95{\%} CI, 17{\%}-82{\%}]) against community-acquired influenza was demonstrated. Substantially lower effectiveness was noted among subjects who were vaccinated in both the current and prior season. There was no evidence that vaccination prevented household transmission once influenza was introduced; adults were at particular risk despite vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Vaccine effectiveness estimates were lower than those demonstrated in other observational studies carried out during the same season. The unexpected findings of lower effectiveness with repeated vaccination and no protection given household exposure require further study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the longitudinal association between serial biomarker measures of circulating omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n3-PUFA) levels and healthy ageing. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Four communities in the United States (Cardiovascular Health Study) from 1992 to 2015. PARTICIPANTS 2622 adults with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (4.8) and with successful healthy ageing at baseline in 1992-93. EXPOSURE Cumulative levels of plasma phospholipid n3-PUFAs were measured using gas chromatography in 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06, expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, including $\alpha$-linolenic acid from plants and eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid from seafoood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Healthy ageing defined as survival without chronic diseases (ie, cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease, and severe chronic kidney disease), the absence of cognitive and physical dysfunction, or death from other causes not part of the healthy ageing outcome after age 65. Events were centrally adjudicated or determined from medical records and diagnostic tests. RESULTS Higher levels of long chain n3-PUFAs were associated with an 18{\%} lower risk (95{\%} confidence interval 7{\%} to 28{\%}) of unhealthy ageing per interquintile range after multivariable adjustments with time-varying exposure and covariates. Individually, higher eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid) levels were associated with a lower risk: 15{\%} (6{\%} to 23{\%}) and 16{\%} (6{\%} to 25{\%}), respectively. $\alpha$-linolenic acid from plants was not noticeably associated with unhealthy ageing (hazard ratio 0.92, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.83 to 1.02). CONCLUSIONS In older adults, a higher cumulative level of serially measured circulating n3-PUFAs from seafood (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid (but not docosahexaenoic acid from seafood or $\alpha$-linolenic acid from plants) was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy ageing. These findings support guidelines for increased dietary consumption of n3-PUFAs in older adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence linking selective migration (the situation where people in good health move from deprived to affluent areas, whilst people in poor health move in the opposite direction) within local areas to mortality is inconclusive. METHODS: Mortality in within-city migrants was examined using a Sheffield population cohort, adjusted for moves to care homes. The cohort comprised 310 894 people aged 25+ years in 2001 followed up for 9.18 years, with 42 252 (13.6{\%}) deaths. Information on pre-existing medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators and smoking was available from a sample survey. RESULTS: Relative risks (95{\%} CI) of mortality in migrants from deprived to affluent areas were lower compared with people remaining in deprived areas; 0.53 (0.42 to 0.65), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.80), 0.76 (0.68 to 0.86), 0.93 (0.88 to 1.00) and 0.98 (0.93 to 1.03) in the 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ year age bands, respectively. They also had lower prevalence ORs (95{\%} CI) for bronchitis (0.59 (0.39 to 0.89)), asthma (0.70 (0.53 to 0.93)), depression (0.59 (0.38 to 0.94)), and were less likely to receive benefits (0.60 (0.47 to 0.76)) and less likely to smoke (0.66 (0.51 to 0.85)).Conversely, mortality relative risks in migrants from affluent to deprived areas were higher compared with people remaining in affluent areas; 1.71 (1.37 to 2.12), 1.59 (1.40 to 1.82), 1.44 (1.26 to 1.63), 1.18 (1.10 to 1.27) and 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09) in the corresponding age groups. They also had higher prevalence odds ratios for long-term illness (2.37 (1.71 to 3.29)), asthma (1.71 (1.25 to 2.35)), diabetes (3.03 (1.70 to 5.41)), depression (2.71 (1.74 to 4.21)), were more likely to receive benefits (2.25 (1.65 to 3.07)) and more likely to smoke (1.51 (1.12 to 2.05)). CONCLUSIONS: People moving from deprived to affluent areas had lower mortality and better health, and vice versa, especially in the younger age groups. This study provides strong evidence linking selective migration within local areas to mortality.},

The purpose of this study, employing electromyography, was to examine the neuromuscular changes that occur with menthol applied to the skin over the quadriceps muscle. METHODS Forty-two healthy volunteers performed isometric knee extensions at 35{\%} maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in three groups (Adult Placebo, Adult Menthol, Older Adult Menthol). Stimulation used was application of 5{\%} menthol gel to the skin. Surface electromyography (sEMG) from the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and rectus femoris (RF) was recorded using miniature pair electrodes. RESULTS Root mean square electromyography (rmsEMG) in VL and VM significantly increased with menthol stimulation both in Adult and Older Adult, but no significant difference was observed between Adult Menthol and Older Adult Menthol. There was a significant decrease in mean power frequency (MPF) in VM with menthol stimulation in Older Adult, but no significant changes were observed in Adult Menthol. CONCLUSION Neuromuscular modulation was observed with the application of menthol gel at low loads in the present study. These findings could lead to a new method of muscular training that targets the recruitment of fast type muscle safe for older adults.},

The whole population was divided in two age groups: A (18-40 years; n. 808; weight 115.4±23.5 kg; BMI 43.8±8.8 kg/m 2 ) and B (41-67 years; n. 438; weight 113.4±26.3 kg; BMI 44.8±9.9 kg/m 2 ). In all the sample there was 2.7{\%} moderate and 0.6{\%} severe sarcopenia; in group A, 1.9{\%} moderate and 0.6{\%} severe sarcopenia whilst in group B 4.3{\%} moderate and 0.7{\%} severe sarcopenia. The results of our study suggest that, based on a screening examination by BIA, moderate/severe sarcopenia can be detected in an unselected middle-aged obese population. Further studies are required to clarify the diagnosis with functional tests.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Little is known about the relation of dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) to metabolic risk factors, particularly in non-Western populations. OBJECTIVE We examined the cross-sectional associations between dietary GI and GL and several metabolic risk factors in healthy Japanese women with traditional dietary habits. DESIGN The subjects were 1354 Japanese female farmers aged 20-78 y from 5 regions of Japan. Dietary GI and GL were assessed with a self-administered diet-history questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height (m). Fasting blood samples were collected for biochemical measurements. RESULTS The mean dietary GI was 67, and the mean dietary GL (/1000 kcal) was 88 (GI for glucose = 100). White rice (GI = 77) was the major contributor to dietary GI and GL (58.5{\%}). After adjustment for potential dietary and nondietary confounding factors, dietary GI was positively correlated with BMI (n = 1354; P for trend = 0.017), fasting triacylglycerol (n = 1349; P for trend = 0.001), fasting glucose (n = 764; P for trend = 0.022), and glycated hemoglobin (n = 845; P for trend = 0.038). Dietary GL was independently negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol (n = 1354; P for trend = 0.004) and positively correlated with fasting triacylglycerol (P for trend = 0.047) and fasting glucose (P for trend = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS Both dietary GI and GL are independently correlated with several metabolic risk factors in subjects whose dietary GI and GL were primarily determined on the basis of the GI of white rice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutrients have been proposed to be related to metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aims of this study were to identify dietary patterns that correlated with several nutrients using reduced rank regression (RRR) and to examine the association between extracted dietary patterns and prevalence of MetS in a Japanese population. METHODS: The study population comprised 1,092 Japanese men and women (35-69 years old) who had participated in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study in Tokushima Prefecture. Dietary patterns were derived with RRR using 46 food items as predictors and six established nutrients (potassium, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, insoluble dietary fiber, and carotene) as response variables. Associations between extracted dietary patterns and MetS were then examined with logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the six dietary patterns, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) explained the largest proportion (60.1{\%}) of variance in the six nutrients. Therefore, only DP1 was selected for further analysis. DP1 was characterized by high intake frequency of vegetables, fruits, fish and small fish, natto (fermented soybeans), and deep-fried tofu. After adjustment for potential confounders, significant inverse associations were found between DP1 score and MetS (odds ratio [OR] for each quartile: 1.00, 0.58, 0.60, 0.52; Ptrend = 0.02); DP1 and high blood pressure (Ptrend = 0.0002); and DP1 and high blood glucose (Ptrend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: A dietary pattern characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruits, fish and small fish, natto, and deep-fried tofu was associated with reduced prevalence of MetS in a Japanese population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the association between adherence to the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top and total and cause specific mortality. DESIGN Large scale population based prospective cohort study in Japan with follow-up for a median of 15 years. SETTING 11 public health centre areas across Japan. PARTICIPANTS 36,624 men and 42,970 women aged 45-75 who had no history of cancer, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, or chronic liver disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deaths and causes of death identified with the residential registry and death certificates. RESULTS Higher scores on the food guide (better adherence) were associated with lower total mortality; the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence interval) of total mortality for the lowest through highest scores were 1.00, 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97), 0.88 (0.83 to 0.93), and 0.85 (0.79 to 0.91) (P{\textless}0.001 for trend) and the multivariable adjusted hazard ratio associated with a 10 point increase in food guide scores was 0.93 (0.91 to 0.95; P{\textless}0.001 for trend). This score was inversely associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio associated with a 10 point increase 0.93, 0.89 to 0.98; P=0.005 for trend) and particularly from cerebrovascular disease (0.89, 0.82 to 0.95; P=0.002 for trend). There was some evidence, though not significant, of an inverse association for cancer mortality (0.96, 0.93 to 1.00; P=0.053 for trend). CONCLUSION Closer adherence to Japanese dietary guidelines was associated with a lower risk of total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease, particularly from cerebrovascular disease, in Japanese adults.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the adequacy and inadequacy of dietary patterns in pregnant women for which information is absolutely lacking. DESIGN Diet was assessed by a validated, self-administered diet history questionnaire (DHQ). Dietary patterns were extracted from the intake of thirty-three food groups (g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)), which were summarized from 147 foods assessed with the DHQ, by cluster analysis. Nutritional inadequacy for selected twenty nutrients in each dietary pattern was examined using the reference values given in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for Japanese as the temporal gold standard. SETTING Japan. SUBJECTS Nine hundred and ninety-seven pregnant Japanese women aged 18-43 years. RESULTS The three dietary patterns identified were labelled as 'meat and eggs' (n 423), 'wheat products' (n 371) and 'rice, fish and vegetables' (n 203). The 'rice, fish and vegetables' pattern characterized by high intake of rice, vegetables, potatoes, pulses, fruits, seaweed, fish and miso soup showed significantly the lowest prevalence of inadequate intake for fifteen nutrients and significantly the highest prevalence of inadequate sodium intake. In contrast, the 'wheat products' pattern characterized by high intake of bread, noodles, confectioneries and soft drinks showed the highest prevalence of inadequate intake for fourteen nutrients. The median number of nutrients not meeting the DRI as a marker of overall nutritional inadequacy was eight in the 'rice, fish and vegetables' pattern. It was significantly lower at ten in the 'meat and eggs' and eleven in the 'wheat products' patterns (P{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS In pregnant Japanese women, the dietary pattern high in rice, fish, vegetables, fruit and some others showed a better profile of nutritional adequacy except for sodium.},

This study was performed to investigate the relationship of leptin to bone metabolism in detail in premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy women. METHODS The relationships between serum leptin level and bone mineral density of several regional sites of the body as well as whole body, along with bone metabolic markers, were examined in 47 premenopausal and 29 postmenopausal healthy women. RESULTS Serum leptin level was weakly correlated with bone mineral density of pelvis (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.39, p{\textless}0.05) and left leg (r=0.41, p{\textless}0.01) in the premenopausal women, although the correlation decreased after adjustment for BMI. There was no significant relationship between serum leptin level and whole body bone mineral density both in the premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Serum leptin level was correlated with serum alkaline phosphatase (r=0.56, p{\textless}0.001) and urinary deoxypyridinoline/cr (r=-0.32, p{\textless}0.05) by Pearson's correlation test in the premenopausal women; the relationships were maintained even after adjustment for BMI (r=0.50 and -0.48, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Leptin is not a key regulator of bone metabolism, although it may have some effects on bone metabolic markers and BMD regionally in premenopausal women.},

abstract = {Studies of the effect of exercise programs on bone mass appear inconsistent. Our objective was to systematically review and meta-analyze randomized trials of the effect of exercise on bone mass in pre- and postmenopausal women. A computerized MEDLINE search was conducted for the years 1966-1997. Thirty-five randomized trials were identified. Meta-analytic methods were used to statistically pool results of studies of the effect of impact (e.g., aerobics) and non-impact (e.g., weight training) exercise on the lumbar spine and femoral neck. The most studied bone site was the lumbar spine in postmenopausal women (15 studies), where both impact [1.6{\%} bone loss prevented, 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI): 1.0{\%}-2.2{\%}] and non-impact (1.0{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 0.4{\%}-1.6{\%}) exercise programs had a positive effect. Results for the lumbar spine in premenopausal women (eight studies) were similar: 1.5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.6{\%}-2.4{\%}) less bone loss (or net gain) after impact exercise and 1.2{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.7{\%}-1.7{\%}) after non-impact exercise. Impact exercise programs appeared to have a positive effect at the femoral neck in postmenopausal women (five studies), 1.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.4{\%}-1.6{\%}) bone loss prevented, and possibly in premenopausal women, 0.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: -0.2{\%}-2.0{\%}) bone loss prevented. There were too few trials to draw conclusions from meta-analyses of the effect of non-impact exercise on the neck of femur. This systematic review of randomized trials shows that both impact and non-impact exercise have a positive effect at the lumbar spine in pre- and postmenopausal women. Impact exercise probably has a positive effect at the femoral neck. More studies are required to determine the optimal intensity and type of exercise.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare the causal effect of overall obesity and abdominal obesity on type 2 diabetes among Chinese Han individuals. METHODS The causal relationship of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with the risk of glucose deterioration and glycemic traits was compared using two different genetic instruments based on 30 BMI loci and 6 WHR loci with Mendelian randomization (MR) in three prospective cohorts (n = 6,476). RESULTS Each 1-SD genetically instrumented higher WHR was associated with a 65.7{\%} higher risk of glucose deterioration (95{\%} CI = 1.069-2.569, P = 0.024), whereas no significant association of BMI with glucose deterioration was observed. Furthermore, a causal relationship was found only between BMI and homeostatic model assessment $\beta$-cell function (HOMA-B) ($\beta$ = 0.143, P = 0.001), and there was a nominal association with Stumvoll second-phase insulin secretion traits ($\beta$ = 0.074, P = 0.022). The significance level did not persist in sensitivity analyses, except in the causal estimate of WHR on the Gutt index in MR-Egger ($\beta$ = -0.379, P = 0.022) and the causal estimate of BMI on homeostatic model assessment $\beta$-cell function in weighted median MR ($\beta$ = 0.128, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS The data from this study support the potential causal relationship between abdominal obesity and hyperglycemia, which may be driven by aggravated insulin resistance, in contrast with the potential causal relationship between overall obesity and insulin secretion.},

OBJECTIVE To determine the association of obesity with bone mineral density (BMD), and its relationship with sex hormone levels. DESIGN A case-control study in Caucasian obese and non obese postmenopausal women. SUBJECTS 113 obese and 50 non-obese postmenopausal women. MEASUREMENTS BMD (dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry) at cervical femur. Ward's triangle, proximal radius and lumbar spine. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, total estrogen, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHA-S) and testosterone. RESULTS Mean BMD at femoral sites were significantly higher in obese women (femoral neck: 0.849 +/- 0.124 g/cm2 vs 0.753 +/- 0.095 g/cm2, P {\textless} 0.001; Ward's triangle: 0.634 +/- 0.134 g/cm2 vs. 0.553 +/- 0.100 g/cm2, P {\textless} 0.001). Mean BMD at lumbar spine was 0.906 +/- 0.138 g/cm2 in obese women and 0.849 +/- 0.137 g/cm2 in non obese, P {\textless} 0.017. A decreased risk of osteopenia in femoral neck (Age adjusted OR = 0.36, 95{\%}CI 0.17-0.75) and in lumbar spine (Age adjusted OR = 0.43, 95{\%}CI 0.20-0.91) in obese women was observed. Although total estrogen were similar in both groups, in obese women, SHBG was lower (68.6 +/- 26.84 nmol/l vs. 85.1 +/- 31.18 nmol/l, P {\textless} 0.001), and postglucose load insulin levels were higher, than in non obese (77.2 +/- 50.4 Ul/ml vs. 49.4 +/- 24.1 Ul/ml, P {\textless} 0.0005). CONCLUSION The findings confirm a higher BMD in obese women and suggest that obesity exerts protection due to a decreased SHBG thus increasing free sex steroids. Besides, hyperinsulinemia may produce a decline in the production of IGFBG-1, leading to an increase of IGF-1, that may stimulate the proliferation of osteoblasts.},

abstract = {Aims To clarify the associations between plasma adiponectin levels and ADIPOQ variants with type 2 diabetes incidence in a general Japanese population. Methods We conducted a case-control study nested within the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. We measured plasma adiponectin levels and genotyped +45T {\textgreater} G (rs2241766) and +276 G {\textgreater} T (rs1501299) in the ADIPOQ gene among 417 incident diabetes cases and 1197 control subjects matched by age, sex, and area. Results After potential confounding factor adjustment, the multivariable-adjusted diabetes odds ratios (ORs) were 0.59 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.51–0.68) and 0.68 (95{\%} CI: 0.60–0.78) per 1 standard deviation increment in the log-transformed levels of total- and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin levels, respectively. However, the ADIPOQ variants were not significantly associated with plasma adiponectin levels (for total adiponectin, +45 P = 0.15 and +276 P = 0.08) and diabetes risk (+45 P = 0.70 and +276 P = 0.72) under the additive genetic model. Conclusions Our prospective findings suggest that both total and HMW adiponectin levels are strongly and inversely associated with diabetes risk after adjustment for potential confounding factors; however, the ADIPOQ variants +45 and +276 are not associated with adiponectin levels and diabetes risk in the general Japanese population.},

In this cross-sectional study, 320 Chinese women, being divided into two groups according to age ≥55 years and {\textless}55 years, were evaluated with quantitative computed tomography (QCT) of the spine to simultaneously evaluate the average trabecular BMD of L2-L4, VAT, and SAT. Possible covariates of height, weight, age, and comorbidities were considered. In the {\textless}55-year-old sample, multiple linear regression analyses indicated that VAT volume was negatively correlated to trabecular BMD (P value = 0.0003) and SAT volume had no correlation to trabecular BMD. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between VAT or SAT and BMD in the ≥55-year-old sample. Our results indicate that high VAT volume is associated with low BMD in Chinese women aged {\textless}55 years and SAT has no relation with BMD.},

abstract = {Objectives Despite the verification of measles elimination, Japan experienced multiple generations of measles transmission following importation events in 2016. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the transmission dynamics of measles in Japan, 2016, estimating the transmission potential in the partially vaccinated population. Methods All diagnosed measles cases were notified to the government, and the present study analyzed two pieces of datasets independently, i.e., the transmission tree of the largest outbreak in Osaka (n = 49) and the final size distribution of all importation events (n = 23 events). Branching process model was employed to estimate the effective reproduction number Rv, and the analysis of transmission tree in Osaka enabled us to account for the timing of introducing contact tracing and case isolation. Results Employing a negative binomial distribution for the offspring distribution, the model with time-dependent decline in Rvdue to interventions appeared to best fit to the transmission tree data with Rvof 9.20 (95{\%} CI (confidence interval): 2.08, 150.68) and the dispersion parameter 0.32 (95{\%} CI: 0.07, 1.17) before interventions were introduced. The relative transmissibility in the presence of interventions from week 34 was estimated at 0.005. Analyzing the final size distribution, models for subcritical and supercritical processes fitted equally well to the observed data, and the estimated reproduction number from both models did not exclude the possibility that Rv{\textgreater} 1. Conclusions Our results likely reflect the highly contagious nature of measles, indicating that Japan is at risk of observing multiple generations of measles transmission given imported cases. Considering that importation events may continue in the future, supplementary vaccination of adults needs to be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Few data are available about the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions for preventing influenza virus transmission. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether hand hygiene and use of facemasks prevents household transmission of influenza. DESIGN Cluster randomized, controlled trial. Randomization was computer generated; allocation was concealed from treating physicians and clinics and implemented by study nurses at the time of the initial household visit. Participants and personnel administering the interventions were not blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00425893) SETTING Households in Hong Kong. PATIENTS 407 people presenting to outpatient clinics with influenza-like illness who were positive for influenza A or B virus by rapid testing (index patients) and 794 household members (contacts) in 259 households. INTERVENTION Lifestyle education (control) (134 households), hand hygiene (136 households), or surgical facemasks plus hand hygiene (137 households) for all household members. MEASUREMENTS Influenza virus infection in contacts, as confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or diagnosed clinically after 7 days. RESULTS Sixty (8{\%}) contacts in the 259 households had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza virus infection in the 7 days after intervention. Hand hygiene with or without facemasks seemed to reduce influenza transmission, but the differences compared with the control group were not significant. In 154 households in which interventions were implemented within 36 hours of symptom onset in the index patient, transmission of RT-PCR-confirmed infection seemed reduced, an effect attributable to fewer infections among participants using facemasks plus hand hygiene (adjusted odds ratio, 0.33 [95{\%} CI, 0.13 to 0.87]). Adherence to interventions varied. LIMITATION The delay from index patient symptom onset to intervention and variable adherence may have mitigated intervention effectiveness. CONCLUSION Hand hygiene and facemasks seemed to prevent household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 hours of index patient symptom onset. These findings suggest that nonpharmaceutical interventions are important for mitigation of pandemic and interpandemic influenza. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Washing the hands using cleansers with antiseptic materials is the most popular method for hand hygiene and helps maintain health by preventing food poisoning and bacterial infections. However, repeated hand washing tends to induce eczema of the hand, such as dryness, cracking and erythema. Moreover, eczema on the hand leads to increased levels of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) on the skin surface in contrast to expectations. Thus, mild hand cleansers which induce less eczema even with repeated washings are desired. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a hand cleanser formulated with alkyl ether sulfate (AES), alkyl ether carboxylic acid (AEC) and alkyl glucoside (AG) that contains isopropyl methylphenol (IPMP) on skin symptoms and S. aureus levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eczema of the hand and the presence of S. aureus on the skin surface were analyzed prior to and following 4 weeks of usage of the hand cleanser. A soap-based hand cleanser with IPMP was used as a reference cleanser. Eczema and cutaneous conditions were evaluated by visual grading, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum moisture-retention ability (MRA) and skin surface pH.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The repeated use of the soap-based hand cleanser significantly worsened the hand dryness, scaling and cracks on the tips of the fingers and significantly increased the TEWL and decreased the MRA. In contrast, usage of the test cleanser only induced a significant increase in skin dryness but did not induce skin scaling or cracking, and did not increase TEWL or decrease the MRA. Corresponding to these changes in skin symptoms, the presence of S. aureus increased following use of the reference cleanser but not the test cleanser. There was no significant difference in skin surface pH between the two cleansers. Moreover the increase in S. aureus was significantly correlated to the worsening of skin dryness and scaling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that not only antimicrobial activity but also the mildness, which minimizes cutaneous effects, are important for hand cleansers to prevent the growth of S. aureus. The cleanser formulated with AES, AEC and AG containing IPMP is mild and is effective to promote hand hygiene. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Morbidity and mortality associated with increased white fat accumulation in visceral fat depots have focused attention on the pathways regulating the development of this tissue during embryogenesis, in adulthood, and while under the influence of obesogenic diets. Adipocytes undergo clonal expansion, differentiation (adipogenesis) and maturation through a complex network of transcriptional factors, most of which are expressed at similar levels in visceral and subcutaneous fat. Rigorous research attempts to unfold the pathways regulating expression and activity of adipogenic transcription factors that act in a fat-depot-specific manner. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) is the master regulator of adipogenesis, and is expressed at higher levels in subcutaneous than in visceral depots. PPAR$\gamma$ expression in adipogenesis is mediated by CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and several transcription factors acting in conjunction with C/EBPs, although alternative pathways through zinc-finger protein-423 (ZFP423) transcription factor are sufficient to induce PPAR$\gamma$ expression and adipogenesis. Vitamin A and its metabolites, retinaldehyde and retinoic acid, are transcriptionally-active molecules. Retinoic acid is generated from retinaldehyde in adipose tissue by the aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 family of enzymes (Aldh1). In this review, we discuss the role of Aldh1 enzymes in the generation of retinoic acid during adipogenesis, in the regulation of the transcriptional network of PPAR$\gamma$ in a fat-depot-specific manner, and the important contribution of this autocrine pathway in the development of visceral obesity.

This study was designed to compare the effects of a web-based program alone or together with measurement and self-awareness of accumulated visceral fat in Japanese workers. A new noninvasive device to measure visceral fat accumulation was introduced, and efficacy on weight-loss and improvement of healthy behaviors were examined. This study was conducted according to Helsinki declaration and approved by the ethical committee of Japan Hospital Organization, National Kyoto Hospital. Two-hundred and sixteen overweight and obese males with BMI of more than 23 participated from 8 healthcare offices of 3 Japanese private companies. Subjects were randomly allocated into control group, Web-based weight-loss program (Web), or Web + Visceral fat measurement group (Web + VFA). Eighty-one percent of participants completed the study. Reductions of body weight, waist circumference, and BMI were the largest in Web + VFA group, and the differences between groups were significant by ANOVA. Improvements of healthy behaviors were the largest in Web + VFA group, and the differences of healthy eating improvement scores between Web + VFA and control groups were significant. Our findings suggest that measurement and awareness of visceral fat are effective in weight reduction in overweight and obese males in the workplace.},

abstract = {Hyaluronan (HA) plays an important role in the development and maintenance of tissues, and its degradation is implicated in many pathologic conditions. We recently reported that HA-binding protein involved in HA depolymerization (CEMIP; alias HYBID/KIAA1199) is a key molecule in HA depolymerization, but its developmental and pathologic functions remain elusive. We generated Hybid-deficient mice using the Cre/locus of crossover in P1 (loxP) system and analyzed their phenotypes. Hybid-deficient mice were viable and fertile, but their adult long bones were shorter than those of wild-type animals. Hybid-deficient mice showed lengthening of hypertrophic zone in the growth plate until 4 weeks after birth. There were fewer capillaries and osteoclasts at the chondroosseous junction in the Hybid-deficient mice compared with the wild-type mice. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Hybid was expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes at the chondroosseous junction. Cultured primary chondrocytes expressed higher levels of Hybid than did osteoblasts or osteoclasts, and the Hybid expression in the chondrocytes was up-regulated after maturation to hypertrophic chondrocytes. High–molecular-weight HA was accumulated in the lengthened hypertrophic zone in Hybid-deficient mice. In addition, high–molecular-weight HA significantly reduced cell growth and tube formation in vascular endothelial growth factor–stimulated or –nonstimulated endothelial cells. HA metabolism by HYBID is involved in endochondral ossification during postnatal development by modulation of angiogenesis and osteoclast recruitment at the chondroosseous junction.},

We calculated the changes in metabolic risk factors in relation to changes in certain anthropometric indices in a large-scale study of Japanese men.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects were 1,106 men participating in the Hitachi Health Study who received a computed tomography examination in both 2004 and 2007. VFA, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and waist circumference were measured using the computed tomography. We examined how longitudinal changes in each anthropometric index over a 3-year period influenced the value of each metabolic risk factor.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Changes ($\Delta$) over a 3-year period in body weight, SFA, and waist circumference strongly correlated, while the changes in body weight and VFA were weakly correlated. Changes in the VFA were associated with changes in metabolic risk factors, especially changes in triglyceride and HDL; we found these changes to be independent of the body weight and waist circumference.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Change in body weight is not a precise surrogate marker of VFA, and repeated VFA measurements over time are useful. Adopting a lifestyle that does not increase the VFA is important in preventing metabolic syndrome.},

Brown rice and white rice supplemented with TASP lowered the postprandial hyperglycemia in humans. TASP and its components (cycloartenol {\{}[{\}}CA], 24-methylene cycloartanol, -sitosterol, and campesterol) decreased postprandial hyperglycemia in C57BL/6J mice. Glucose transport into everted rat intestinal sacs and human HuTu80 cells transfected with sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1) was significantly reduced by the addition of CA. Intracellular localization analysis suggested that SGLT1 translocation to the apical plasma membrane was inhibited when the cells were treated with CA. ConclusionsWe demonstrated for the first time that TASP from rice bran lowered postprandial hyperglycemia in mice and humans. The smaller increase in blood glucose following TASP consumption may be due to the CA-induced decrease in glucose absorption from the intestine, which may be related to decreased membrane translocation of SGLT1.},

abstract = {Observational epidemiological studies are prone to confounding, reverse causation and various biases and have generated findings that have proved to be unreliable indicators of the causal effects of modifiable exposures on disease outcomes. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that utilizes genetic variants that are robustly associated with such modifiable exposures to generate more reliable evidence regarding which interventions should produce health benefits. The approach is being widely applied, and various ways to strengthen inference given the known potential limitations of MR are now available. Developments of MR, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, network MR, two-step MR, factorial MR and multiphenotype MR, are outlined in this review. The integration of genetic information into population-based epidemiological studies presents translational opportunities, which capitalize on the investment in genomic discovery research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is not yet resolved how lifestyle factors and intermediate phenotypes interrelate with metabolic pathways. We aimed to investigate the associations between diet, physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and obesity with serum metabolite networks in a population-based study. METHODS: The present study included 2380 participants of a randomly drawn subcohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam. Targeted metabolomics was used to measure 127 serum metabolites. Additional data were available including anthropometric measurements, dietary assessment including intake of whole-grain bread, coffee and cake and cookies by food frequency questionnaire, and objectively measured physical activity energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory fitness in a subsample of 100 participants. In a data-driven approach, Gaussian graphical modeling was used to draw metabolite networks and depict relevant associations between exposures and serum metabolites. In addition, the relationship of different exposure metabolite networks was estimated. RESULTS: In the serum metabolite network, the different metabolite classes could be separated. There was a big group of phospholipids and acylcarnitines, a group of amino acids and C6-sugar. Amino acids were particularly positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. C6-sugar and acylcarnitines were positively associated with obesity and inversely with intake of whole-grain bread. Phospholipids showed opposite associations with obesity and coffee intake. Metabolite networks of coffee intake and obesity were strongly inversely correlated (body mass index (BMI): r = -0.57 and waist circumference: r = -0.59). A strong positive correlation was observed between metabolite networks of BMI and waist circumference (r = 0.99), as well as the metabolite networks of cake and cookie intake with cardiorespiratory fitness and intake of whole-grain bread (r = 0.52 and r = 0.50; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle factors and phenotypes seem to interrelate in various metabolic pathways. A possible protective effect of coffee could be mediated via counterbalance of pathways of obesity involving hepatic phospholipids. Experimental studies should validate the biological mechanisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Adiponectin is a key mediator of the metabolic syndrome that is caused by visceral fat accumulation. Adiponectin and its receptors are known to be expressed in osteoblasts, but their actions with regard to bone metabolism are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of adiponectin on the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. RESULTS Adiponectin receptor type 1 (AdipoR1) mRNA was detected in the cells by RT-PCR. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) was phosphorylated by both adiponectin and a pharmacological AMP kinase activator, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR), in the cells. AdipoR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection potently knocked down the receptor mRNA, and the effect of this knockdown persisted for as long as 10 days after the transfection. The transfected cells showed decreased expressions of type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA, as determined by real-time PCR, and reduced ALP activity and mineralization, as determined by von Kossa and Alizarin red stainings. In contrast, AMP kinase activation by AICAR (0.01-0.5 mM) in wild-type MC3T3-E1 cells augmented their proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. BrdU assay showed that the addition of adiponectin (0.01-1.0 mug/ml) also promoted their proliferation. Osterix, but not Runx-2, appeared to be involved in these processes because AdipoR1 siRNA transfection and AICAR treatments suppressed and enhanced osterix mRNA expression, respectively. CONCLUSION Taken together, this study suggests that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization of osteoblasts via the AdipoR1 and AMP kinase signaling pathways in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions.},

The girls who ate large amounts of snack foods in the absence of hunger at 5 and 7 y of age were 4.6 times as likely to be overweight at both ages. Parents' reports of restricting their daughter's access to foods at age 5 y predicted girls' eating in the absence of hunger at age 7 y, even when the girls' weight status and eating in the absence of hunger at age 5 y were controlled for.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that young girls' eating in the absence of hunger may represent a stable phenotypic behavior of young overweight girls.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE A meta-analysis showed an inverse association of a prudent/healthy dietary pattern with all-cause mortality and no association of a western/unhealthy dietary pattern. However, the association of distinctive dietary patterns of Japanese population with mortality remains unclear. We prospectively investigated the association between dietary patterns and all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality among Japanese adults. METHODS Participants were 36,737 men and 44,983 women aged 45-74 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (1995-1998) and who had no history of serious disease. Dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis of the consumption of 134 food and beverage items ascertained by a food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios of death from the second survey to December 2012 were estimated using cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS A prudent dietary pattern, which was characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruit, soy products, potatoes, seaweed, mushrooms, and fish, was significantly associated with decreased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality for the highest versus lowest quartile of the prudent dietary pattern score were 0.82 (0.77 to 0.86) and 0.72 (0.64 to 0.79), respectively (P for trend {\textless}0.001 in both). A Westernized dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of meat, processed meat, bread, and dairy products, was also inversely associated with risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality. A traditional Japanese dietary pattern was not associated with these risks. CONCLUSIONS The prudent and Westernized dietary patterns were associated with a decreased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in Japanese adults.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Increased body fat is a risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, yet it is uncertain whether obesity protects against osteoporosis or adiposity is harmful to bone. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to assess whether the pattern of adipose tissue deposition influences bone structure and strength. DESIGN The relations between sc and visceral adiposity and the cross-sectional dimensions and polar and principal moments of the femur in 100 healthy women ages 15 to 25 years were obtained using computed tomography. RESULTS Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that, after adjusting for leg length and thigh musculature, both sc and visceral fat had strong and independent associations with femoral cross-sectional area, cortical bone area, principal moment maximum, principal moment minimum, and polar moment (all P values {\textless} 0.03). However, whereas sc fat had a positive predictive value with all femoral bone phenotypes, a similar but negative effect was observed between visceral fat and these measures (all P values {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS We found that visceral and sc fat have opposite effects on the appendicular skeleton; whereas sc fat is beneficial to bone structure and strength, visceral fat serves as an unique pathogenic fat depot.},

abstract = {Leptin, the product of the ob gene, has been shown to inhibit bone formation in mice. We addressed whether leptin has any role in the regulation of bone mineral density (BMD) in humans. Subjects were 221 adult men with a mean (+/-SD) age and body mass index of 52.1 +/- 8.7 yr and 23.6 +/- 2.8 kg/m2. Serum leptin, carboxyterminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (PICP; a marker of bone formation), and cross-linked carboxyterminal teleopeptide of type 1 collagen (a marker of bone resorption) were measured by RIA. BMD was assessed by single photon absorptiometry, and total fat mass was determined by bioimpedance analysis. BMD was inversely associated with serum leptin concentrations and total fat mass after adjustment for body weight. PICP, but not cross-linked carboxyterminal teleopeptide of type 1 collagen, was inversely correlated with serum leptin. These results may suggest that an increase in serum leptin reduces bone formation and decreases BMD in adult men. Leptin may be a regulator of BMD in humans.},

abstract = {Sarcopenia, a newly recognized geriatric syndrome, is characterized by age-related decline of skeletal muscle plus low muscle strength and/or physical performance. Previous studies have confirmed the association of sarcopenia and adverse health outcomes, such as falls, disability, hospital admission, long term care placement, poorer quality of life, and mortality, which denotes the importance of sarcopenia in the health care for older people. Despite the clinical significance of sarcopenia, the operational definition of sarcopenia and standardized intervention programs are still lacking. It is generally agreed by the different working groups for sarcopenia in the world that sarcopenia should be defined through a combined approach of muscle mass and muscle quality, however, selecting appropriate diagnostic cutoff values for all the measurements in Asian populations is challenging. Asia is a rapidly aging region with a huge population, so the impact of sarcopenia to this region is estimated to be huge as well. Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) aimed to promote sarcopenia research in Asia, and we collected the best available evidences of sarcopenia researches from Asian countries to establish the consensus for sarcopenia diagnosis. AWGS has agreed with the previous reports that sarcopenia should be described as low muscle mass plus low muscle strength and/or low physical performance, and we also recommend outcome indicators for further researches, as well as the conditions that sarcopenia should be assessed. In addition to sarcopenia screening for community-dwelling older people, AWGS recommends sarcopenia assessment in certain clinical conditions and healthcare settings to facilitate implementing sarcopenia in clinical practice. Moreover, we also recommend cutoff values for muscle mass measurements (7.0 kg/m2for men and 5.4 kg/m2for women by using dual X-ray absorptiometry, and 7.0 kg/m2for men and 5.7 kg/m2for women by using bioimpedance analysis), handgrip strength ({\textless}26 kg for men and {\textless}18 kg for women), and usual gait speed ({\textless}0.8 m/s). However, a number of challenges remained to be solved in the future. Asia is made up of a great number of ethnicities. The majority of currently available studies have been published from eastern Asia, therefore, more studies of sarcopenia in south, southeastern, and western Asia should be promoted. On the other hand, most Asian studies have been conducted in a cross-sectional design and few longitudinal studies have not necessarily collected the commonly used outcome indicators as other reports from Western countries. Nevertheless, the AWGS consensus report is believed to promote more Asian sarcopenia research, and most important of all, to focus on sarcopenia intervention studies and the implementation of sarcopenia in clinical practice to improve health care outcomes of older people in the communities and the healthcare settings in Asia. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Medical Directors Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Aims Review controlled clinical trials of isoflavones and amino acid preparation effects on hot flashes and at least one other symptom including mood, sleep, pain, and cognitive function that women report during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause. Methods An experienced reference librarian searched PubMed/Medline, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, AMED, and Alt-Health Watch for English-language randomized controlled trials between 2004 and July 2011. Seventeen trials of isoflavones and amino acid effects on hot flashes and one additional symptom were identified. Results In five trials of soy isoflavone preparations, two (6 g soy germ extract and 25 g soy protein in soy nuts) significantly decreased hot flashes, but no other symptoms. In the seven trials of other isoflavones, six significantly reduced hot flashes; in addition, red clover (80 mg) significantly reduced mood symptoms; Rexflavone (350 mg) for women with Kupperman Index {\textgreater} 20 significantly reduced sleep symptoms; two trials had significant reductions for pain: isoflavone powder (90 mg) and red clover (80 mg). The only trial in this systematic review that significantly reduced cognitive symptoms was red clover (80 mg). In one trial, red clover isoflavone (80 mg/day) significantly relieved hot flashes, mood, pain, and cognitive symptoms. Amino acids yielded no significant results. Equol supplements of 30 mg/day for non-Equol producing women significantly reduced mood symptoms in one trial. The magnolia bark extract combination significantly reduced hot flashes, mood, and sleep symptoms. Conclusions Isoflavone trials yielded significant reductions on hot flashes and co-occurring symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopause, but studies require replication with larger sample sizes and attention to measurement of outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {While there have been significant advances in capturing data from the entities across complex real-world systems, their associations and relationships are largely unknown. Associations between the entities may reveal interesting system-level properties that may not be apparent otherwise. Often these associations are hypothesized by superimposing knowledge across distinct reductionist representations of these entities obtained from disparate sources. Such representations, while useful, may provide only an incomplete picture of the associations. This can be attributed to their dependence on prior knowledge and failure of the principle of superposition in general. Such representations may also be unhelpful in discovering novel undocumented associations. A more rigorous approach would be to identify associations from data measured simultaneously across the entities of interest from a given system. These data sets or digital signatures are quantized in time and amplitude and in turn may (dynamic) or may not (static) contain explicit temporal information. Symmetric measures such as correlation have been helpful in modeling direct associations as undirected graphs. However, it is well appreciated that the association between a given pair of entities may be indirect and often mediated through others. Symmetric measures are also immune to the direction of association by their very definition. Graphical models such as Bayesian networks have especially proven to be useful in this regard. The vertices (nodes) represent the entities of interest, the arcs (edges) represent their associations, and the entire Bayesian network represents the joint probability distribution between the entities of interest. Bayesian networks networks. It introduces the reader to structure and parameter learning from multiple independent realizations of data sets without explicit temporal information. Such data sets are quite common and represent a snapshot of the process. The impact of discretization on the network inference with application to molecular expression data is also discussed. The lack of temporal information implicitly excludes the presence of feedback or cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graphical representation of the associations between the entities. These limitations are overcome by learning networks from data sets with explicit temporal signatures. In Chap. 3, we discuss the usefulness of dynamic Bayesian networks for learning the network structure in the presence of explicit temporal information such as multivariate time series. Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks are discussed. In Chap. 4, static and dynamic Bayesian network inference methods are discussed. Some of the network learning algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are computationally intensive limiting their usefulness across large and high-dimensional data sets. Parallelization options for some of the algorithms discussed in the earlier chapters are discussed in Chap. 5 to overcome some of these limitations.},

abstract = {To investigate the relationship between angiotensinogen (AGT) Met235Thr polymorphism (M235T) and human obesity, because AGT is regarded as one of the cytokines produced from adipocytes and serum AGT concentrations are reported to be positively correlated with body mass index. One hundred and twenty obese Japanese women (age, 58.8 ± 9.4 years; body mass index, 32.2 ± 4.9 kg/m2) were enrolled. Angiotensinogen genotypes were determined with a fluorescent allele-specific DNA primer assay system. Subjects were divided into M/M, M/T, and T/T groups. Control subjects comprised 146 healthy age-matched women. Clinical characteristics and the effects of diet and exercise therapy for 6 months were compared among the 3 genotypes. The genotype frequencies of AGT M235T polymorphism were in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equation (obese: M/M, 6.7{\%}; M/T, 27.5{\%}; T/T, 65.8{\%}; control: M/M, 6.8{\%}; M/T, 21.2{\%}; T/T, 71.9{\%}). The frequency of the T allele did not differ between obese and control subjects (0.80 vs 0.83). As the number of obese women with M/M genotype was only 8, comparisons of the characteristics and outcomes of weight reduction therapy were performed only between subjects with M/T genotype and T/T genotype. In the T/T group, {\%} body fat and waist circumference at baseline were significantly greater than in the M/T group (36.3{\%} ± 4.8{\%} vs 33.8{\%} ± 4.7{\%}, P = .0105; 107.9 ± 10.9 vs 102.6 ± 7.9 cm, P = .0428, respectively). Before the weight reduction therapy, significantly higher insulin and higher homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R) were demonstrated in the T/T group than in the M/T group (9.1 ± 5.5 $\mu$U/mL vs 5.9 ± 4.4 $\mu$U/mL, P = .0056; 2.3 ± 1.4 vs 1.6 ± 1.3, P = .0252, respectively). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline in the T/T group tended to be higher than those in the M/T group, but the differences were not significant. No genotype-dependent difference in energy expenditure or outcome of weight reduction therapy was observed with respect to AGT M235T polymorphism. After the diet and exercise therapy, the blood pressure in the T/T group tended to be higher than that in the M/T group, but the difference was not significant. We demonstrated that the T/T genotype of the AGT M235T gene polymorphism was positively related to visceral obesity and hyperinsulinemia in obese Japanese women. Blood pressure did not show genotype-specific differences before or after the treatment. Further studies of the association between obesity and this gene polymorphism should contribute to understanding and treating obesity-related diseases. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {UNLABELLED We examined ethnic difference in the association of body fat and trunk fat with bone mineral density (BMD) among Chinese, white, and black subjects. We found that, with greater body and trunk fat, both white and black subjects were more likely to have a low BMD than Chinese subjects. INTRODUCTION Ethnic differences in body fat, abdominal fat distribution, and BMD have been found in previous studies between Chinese and white subjects. However, the associations of body fat and abdominal fat distribution with BMD have not been studied, and whether the ethnic differences have an effect on these associations is unclear. METHODS We evaluated 1,147 subjects aged ≥ 18 years (805 Chinese, 193 whites, and 149 blacks). Percent body fat ({\%}BF), percent trunk fat ({\%}TF), and total and regional BMD including that of head, arm, leg, trunk, rib, spine, and pelvis were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Linear regression models were developed to test the association of ethnicity, {\%}BF, and interaction between ethnicity and {\%}BF with BMD. The models were repeated again, replacing {\%}BF with {\%}TF. RESULTS Chinese subjects showed lower BMD in total and most regions compared with black and white subjects; however, these differences were eliminated between Chinese and whites within both sexes and between Chinese and black men when age, weight, height, and {\%}BF were added. {\%}BF and {\%}TF were negatively associated with most regional body BMD. The interactions between {\%}BF, {\%}TF, and ethnicity were found in most regional body BMD among Chinese, white, and black subjects for both men and women. CONCLUSION Both {\%}BF and {\%}TF have negative associations with BMD. With greater accumulation of {\%}BF and {\%}TF, both white and black subjects may experience a higher risk of low BMD than Chinese subjects.},

abstract = {Geometry in the simplex has been developed in the last 15 years mainly based on the contributions due to J. Aitchison. The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The circulating levels of ?-carotene are modulated not only by sex, but also by autosomal gene variations and fruit intake. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactions between ?-carotene metabolism-related gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; genetic factors) and nutrient intake (environmental factors) relating to their effects on circulating ?-carotene. The serum concentrations of ?-carotene and the habitual food intake of 92 healthy Japanese adults were examined. All subjects were genotyped for three common SNPs: rs6564851 in the ?-carotene 15,150 -oxygenase 1 (BCO1) gene, rs2278986 in the scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) gene and rs362090 in the intestine-specific homeobox (ISX) gene. Univariate analysis revealed that the circulating ?-carotene levels were significantly higher in rs6564851 GG homozygotes (p = 0.003). Additionally, the daily intake of ?-cryptoxanthin was positively associated with the circulating ?-carotene levels in female GG homozygotes of rs6564851 (p = 0.023), and the daily intake of ?- and ?-carotenes, and ?-cryptoxanthin was significantly lower in female rs6564851 T allele carries than in female GG homozygotes (p = 0.009, 0.008, 0.009, respectively). The present study apparently indicates that higher circulating ?-carotene levels in female rs6564851 GG homozygotes depensd on carotenoid intake.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the body fat distribution and fat cell size and number in an overweight/obese population from both genders, and to determine the possible relationship between fat cell data from three different adipose tissue localizations (subcutaneous (SA), perivisceral and omental) and adipose tissue composition and dietary fatty acid. DESIGN: The sample consisted of 84 overweight/obese patients (29 men and 55 women) who have undergone abdominal surgery. The adipocyte size and total fat cell number was studied. Fat cell data were related with anthropometric, adipose tissue and subject's habitual diet fatty acid composition. MEASUREMENTS: Fat cell size was measured according to a Sj{\"{o}}str{\"{o}}m method from the three adipose depots. Total fat cell number was also calculated. The fatty acid composition of adipose tissue was examined by gas chromatography. The subjects diet was studied by a 7 days dietary record. RESULTS: Our data showed a negative relationship between the adipocyte size and the n-6 and n-3 fatty acids content of the SA adipose tissue (r=-0.286, P=0,040; r=-0.300, P=0.030) respectively, and the n-6 in the omental depots (r=-0.407, P=0.049) in the total population. Positive associations with the total of saturated (r=0.357, P=0.045) and negative (r=-0.544, P=0.001) with the n-9 fatty acids were observed when the relationship between the adipocyte number and the fatty acid composition of the different anatomical fat regions was studied. Dietary fatty acids composition positively correlated with fat cell size for the myristic acid (14:0) in men in the visceral depot (r=0.822, P=0.023), and for the saturated fatty acids (SFAs) in women in the omental depot (r=0.486, P=0.035). CONCLUSION: In the present study, for the first time in humans we found that n-3 and n-6 fatty acids are related to a reduced adipocyte size according to the depot localization. In contrast, adipose tissue and dietary SFAs significantly correlated with an increase in fat cell size and number. No significant associations were found between n-9 acids content and adipocyte size. However, n-9 adipose tissue fatty acids content was inversely associated with fat cell number showing that this type of fatty acid could limit hyperplasia in obese populations. The differences observed in the three different regions, perivisceral, omental and SA fat, indicate that this population adipose tissue have depot-specific differences.},

abstract = {Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that an increased intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids protects against mortality from coronary artery disease. We aimed to test the hypothesis that long-term use of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is effective for prevention of major coronary events in hypercholesterolaemic patients in Japan who consume a large amount of fish. Methods: 18 645 patients with a total cholesterol of 6{\textperiodcentered}5 mmol/L or greater were recruited from local physicians throughout Japan between 1996 and 1999. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1800 mg of EPA daily with statin (EPA group; n=9326) or statin only (controls; n=9319) with a 5-year follow-up. The primary endpoint was any major coronary event, including sudden cardiac death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and other non-fatal events including unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, stenting, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00231738. Findings: At mean follow-up of 4{\textperiodcentered}6 years, we detected the primary endpoint in 262 (2{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) patients in the EPA group and 324 (3{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}) in controls-a 19{\%} relative reduction in major coronary events (p=0{\textperiodcentered}011). Post-treatment LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased 25{\%}, from 4{\textperiodcentered}7 mmol/L in both groups. Serum LDL cholesterol was not a significant factor in a reduction of risk for major coronary events. Unstable angina and non-fatal coronary events were also significantly reduced in the EPA group. Sudden cardiac death and coronary death did not differ between groups. In patients with a history of coronary artery disease who were given EPA treatment, major coronary events were reduced by 19{\%} (secondary prevention subgroup: 158 [8{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}] in the EPA group vs 197 [10{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}] in the control group; p=0{\textperiodcentered}048). In patients with no history of coronary artery disease, EPA treatment reduced major coronary events by 18{\%}, but this finding was not significant (104 [1{\textperiodcentered}4{\%}] in the EPA group vs 127 [1{\textperiodcentered}7{\%}] in the control group; p=0{\textperiodcentered}132). Interpretation: EPA is a promising treatment for prevention of major coronary events, and especially non-fatal coronary events, in Japanese hypercholesterolaemic patients. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {AbstrAct background Alcohol control policy has a fundamental role in limiting negative health, economic and social harm caused by alcohol consumption. However, there is substantial international heterogeneity in country-level policy adoption, implementation and monitoring. Comparative measures so far focused on Europe or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Methods We created an Alcohol Control Policy Index (ACPI) for 167 countries using five different methodological approaches. National policies were sourced from WHO's Global Information System on Alcohol and Health. We assessed ACPI's criterion-related validity by calculating the strength of the association among the different approaches. As for content validity, we tested whether the resulting scores explained variations in alcohol per capita consumption cross-nationally, controlling for gross domestic product, population age, urbanisation and world region using OLS and random coefficients models. results Index scores and ranks from different methodological approaches are highly correlated (r=0.99). Higher scores were associated with lower consumption across the five methods. For each 1 score increase in the ACPI, the reduction in per capita alcohol consumption varies from −0.024 L (95{\%} CI (−0.043 to −0.004) to −0.014 L (95{\%} CI (−0.034 to 0.005). We obtain larger coefficients and p values {\textless}0.005 when estimating random coefficients. conclusion ACPI offers a measure of alcohol control policy across countries that makes use of a larger number of countries than its predecessors, as well as a wider range of methodologies for its calculation, both of which contribute to its validity. Furthermore, it shows that the statutory strictness of alcohol control policies is associated with lower levels of alcohol consumption.},

Sarcopenia, decreased muscle volume and muscle weakness in the elderly is a serious risk of various adverse outcomes. Current diagnostic procedure for sarcopenia includes gait speed, grip strength, and percentage of skeletal muscle volume. However, lower leg muscle strength decreases much faster than grasp power, and we have evaluated the usefulness of its measurement using a recently developed instrument (Locomoscan). 

METHODS
Forty-three institutionalized elderly subjects were evaluated for their anthropometrical parameters, body composition, grasp and lower leg muscle strength, and gait speed. They were categorized into 2 groups; gait speed equal to or higher than 0.8 m/s and that below 0.8 m/s. 

RESULTS
Leg muscle strength per body weight was significantly greater in those with their gait speed equal to or higher than 0.8 m/s, whereas there was no significant difference in other parameters. Receiver operator characteristics analysis has shown that leg muscle alone significantly predicted the greater gait speed. 

CONCLUSIONS
Lower leg muscle strength can be useful for predicting gait speed.},

abstract = {The National High Blood Pressure Education Program presents the complete Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Like its predecessors, the purpose is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are these: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (BP) of greater than 140 mm Hg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90{\%} lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions that are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP ({\textless}140/90 mm Hg, or {\textless}130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease; for patients whose BP is more than 20 mm Hg above the systolic BP goal or more than 10 mm Hg above the diastolic BP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

abstract = {Isokinetic contraction is the muscular contraction that accompanies constant velocity limb movements around a joint. The velocity of movement is maintained constant by a special dynamometer. The resistance of the dynamometer is equal to the muscular forces applied throughout the range of movement. This method allows the measurement of the muscular forces in dynamic conditions and provides optimal loading of the muscles. However, during movements in the vertical plane, the torque registered by the dynamometer is the resultant torque produced by the muscular and gravitational forces. The error depends on the angular position and the torque potential of the tested muscle group. Several methods have been developed for the correction of gravitational errors in isokinetic data. The torque output also contains artefacts that are associated with the inertial forces during acceleration and deceleration periods before the development of the constant preset angular velocity. For an accurate assessment of muscle function, only constant velocity data should be analysed. The most frequently used isokinetic parameters are the maximum torque and the angular position where it was recorded, the torque output at different angular velocities of movement, the torque ratio of reciprocal muscle groups and the torque output during repeated contractions. The unique features of isokinetic dynamometry are optimal loading of the muscles in dynamic conditions and constant preselected velocity of movement. These features provide safety in the rehabilitation of patients with muscular and ligamentous injuries. Isokinetic dynamometry has also been used for the training of various muscle groups in order to improve the muscular performance in dynamic conditions. The movement velocity of different activities can be simulated during training in order to improve the training effect. Data acquisition and analysis have been improved by using computer systems interfaced to isokinetic dynamometers. Recently developed computer systems provide correction for gravitational and inertial errors, accurate computation of isokinetic parameters and real-time display of the torque output.},

Among patients with confirmed hepatotoxicity, there was no statistically significant association between the presence of catechin or the dose consumed and liver injury causality score, severity, or pattern of liver injury. Catechin levels tended to be highest in products used for weight loss, although catechin concentrations were low in most products.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many HDS commonly contain catechins that are implicated in hepatotoxicity, although their presence may not be indicated on the product label. Although our results did not establish an association between GTE or catechins with hepatotoxicity, they highlight some of the many complexities and uncertainties that surround the attribution of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) to HDS.},

abstract = {This event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) study investigated BOLD signal change in response to a series of pure gustatory stimuli that varied in stimulus quality when subjects were hungry and sated with a nutritional pre-load. Group analyses showed significant differences in activation in the hunger minus satiety condition in response to sucrose, caffeine, saccharin, and citric acid within the thalamus, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. When examining the hunger and satiety conditions, activation varied as a function of stimulus, with the majority of the stimuli exhibiting significantly greater activation in the hunger state within the insula, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in contrast to decreased activation in the satiated state within the parahippocampus, hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate. Region of interest (ROI) analysis revealed two significant interactions, ROI by physiology and ROI by physiology by stimulus. In the satiety condition, the primary (inferior and superior insulae) and secondary (OFC 11 and OFC 47) taste regions exhibited significantly greater brain activation in response to all stimuli than regions involved in processing eating behavior (hypothalamus), affect (amygdala), and memory (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex). These same regions demonstrated significantly greater activation within the hunger condition than the satiety condition, with the exception of the superior insula. Furthermore, the patterns of activation differed as a function taste stimulus, with greater activation in response to sucrose than to the other stimuli. These differential patterns of activation suggest that the physiological states of hunger and satiety produce divergent activation in multiple brain areas in response to different pure gustatory stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An association between coffee drinking and reduced risk of liver cancer has been suggested by animal studies, but epidemiologic evidence of such an association in a high-risk population is lacking. We conducted a large-scale population-based cohort study of the association between coffee drinking and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Japanese population. METHODS: Newly diagnosed case patients (250 men and 84 women) with HCC were identified from a 10-year follow-up of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, which consists of 90,452 middle-aged and elderly Japanese subjects (43,109 men and 47,343 women). Case patients were grouped according to coffee intake and were stratified by hepatitis virus infection, sex, age, diet, lifestyle factors, and previous history of liver disease. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for HCC were calculated with Cox proportional-hazards modeling. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Subjects (men and women combined) who consumed coffee on a daily or almost daily basis had a lower HCC risk than those who almost never drank coffee (HR = 0.49 [95{\%} CI = 0.36 to 0.66]); risk decreased with the amount of coffee consumed (compared with nondrinkers, the HR for 1-2 cups per day = 0.52 [95{\%} CI = 0.38 to 0.73]; for 3-4 cups per day = 0.48 [95{\%} CI = 0.28 to 0.83]; for {\textgreater} or =5 cups per day = 0.24 [95{\%} CI = 0.08 to 0.77], P(trend) {\textless} .001). The risk of liver cancer in almost never drinkers in this population was 547.2 cases per 100,000 people over 10 years, but it was 214.6 cases per 100 000 people with drinking coffee on a daily basis. The inverse association persisted when the participants were stratified by lifestyle factors. Similar associations were observed when the analysis was restricted to hepatitis C virus-positive patients (all daily drinkers compared with nondrinkers: HR =0.57 [95{\%} CI = 0.37 to 0.86]), to hepatitis B virus-positive patients (HR = 0.60 [95{\%} CI = 0.31 to 1.18]) and to subjects with no past history of chronic liver disease (HR = 0.45 [95{\%} CI = 0.30 to 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: In the Japanese population, habitual coffee drinking may be associated with reduced risk of HCC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Recent studies have suggested that VAT negatively affects bone. However, MetS has also been associated with higher estradiol (E2) levels, which is bone protective. We therefore investigated the impact of VAT and E2 levels on bone density, structural parameters, and strength estimates. DESIGN A cross-sectional study was conducted in 72 obese men with MetS to investigate the impact of VAT and E2 levels on bone. METHODS Bone parameters were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and high-resolution peripheral QCT (HRpQCT) at lumbar spine, proximal femur, radius, and tibia. VAT volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sexual hormones were measured in blood samples. RESULTS Men with high VAT had a lower bone density at the hip (P{\textless}0.05), lower cortical thickness, and higher buckling ratio at femoral neck (FN) (P=0.008 and P=0.02), compared with men with low VAT, despite a similar body weight and BMI. Generally, E2 levels were low (median 43 pmol/l), and men with E2 levels below median had reduced bone density at lumbar spine (P=0.04), and impaired structural parameters at radius and tibia, compared with men with E2 levels above median. At the hip, VAT volume and E2 levels affected bone density independently and additively, and 50{\%} of men with high VAT and low E2 levels had osteopenia with significantly lower T-score at FN (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS High VAT and low E2 negatively affect bone in obese men with MetS. VAT and E2 affect bone density at the hip independently and additively, revealing an unexpected high prevalence of osteopenia in middle-aged men with MetS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potential therapeutic target against obesity and diabetes through thermogenesis and substrate disposal with cold exposure. The role of BAT in energy metabolism under thermoneutral conditions, however, remains controversial. We assessed the contribution of BAT to energy expenditure (EE), particularly diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), and substrate utilization in human adults. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, BAT activity was evaluated in 21 men using (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) after cold exposure (19 °C). The subjects were divided into BAT-positive (n=13) and BAT-negative (n=8) groups according to the (18)F-FDG-PET/CT findings. Twenty-four hour EE, DIT, and respiratory quotient were measured using a whole-room indirect calorimeter at 27 °C. RESULTS Body composition, blood metabolites, and 24-h EE did not differ between groups. DIT ({\%}), calculated as DIT divided by total energy intake, however, was significantly higher in the BAT-positive group (BAT-positive: 9.7±2.5{\%}, BAT-negative: 6.5±4.0{\%}, P=0.03). The 24-h respiratory quotient was significantly lower (P=0.03) in the BAT-positive group (0.860±0.028) than in the BAT-negative group (0.889±0.024). CONCLUSION DIT and fat utilization were higher in BAT-positive subjects compared to BAT-negative subjects, suggesting that BAT has a physiologic role in energy metabolism.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 19 July 2016. doi:10.1038/ijo.2016.124.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Prevention, early detection and effective rehabilitation of dysphagia are important issues to be considered in an aging society. Previous studies have shown conflicting findings regarding the association between dysphagia and its potential risk factors, including age, malnutrition, oral conditions, lifestyle and medical history. Herein, we assessed the prevalence and association of dysphagia with potential risk factors in 50- to 79-year-old adults dwelling in a community in Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this study, there were 532 participants (185 males and 347 females). Participants who responded positively to the question "Do you sometimes choke on drinks/food such as tea and soup?" or those who presented with abnormal repetitive saliva swallowing test findings were diagnosed with dysphagia. The data collected from these participants included the following: number of teeth, occurrence of oral dryness, age, body mass index, serum albumin concentration, smoking, drinking and exercise habits, presence of diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and questions from the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS Dysphagia was observed in 33 males (17.8{\%}) and 76 females (21.9{\%}). To explore the effect of the potential risk factors on the prevalence of dysphagia, a model was built by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Using the forced entry method, oral dryness (odds ratio [OR] =3.683 and P=0.003 in males; OR =1.797 and P=0.032 in females) and the number of teeth (OR =0.946 and P=0.038 in males) were found to be significantly related to dysphagia. CONCLUSION This cross-sectional study demonstrated associations between oral conditions and dysphagia. Factors such as oral dryness and number of teeth may contribute to dysphagia more so than aging, lifestyle and comorbidity in community-dwelling adults over the age of 50.},

abstract = {Background: Visceral fat is considered important in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MS). Here, we developed a novel method for determining visceral fat by measuring liver–kidney space (LKS) on abdominal sonography and expanded its utilization in the elderly to predict MS. Methods: To assess the correlation between the LKS and MS, 317 consecutive outpatients scheduled for health evaluation were retrospective analyzed. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose levels, and lipid profiles were obtained following standard protocols. On sonography, the thickness of visceral fat between the liver and right kidney was measured. We also compared its accuracy to predict MS with sonographic fatty liver changes. A total of 72 elderly patients older than 65 years were evaluated (mean age: 66.02 [65–83]). Results: In the current study, LKS = 4 mm enabled a better prediction of MS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.626. The sensitivity and specificity for the presence of visceral fat to predict MS in the elderly were 0.58 and 0.73, respectively. The accuracy to predict MS was 68.1{\%} for the measurement of visceral fat compared with 59.6{\%} for sonographic fatty liver change in the elderly. Conclusion: Measuring LKS by sonography may be a practical method for evaluating visceral fat in the elderly and for predicting MS better than sonographic fatty liver changes. LKS was more associated with abdominal girth and BMI in the elderly from the study supporting the observation that LKS are well correlated with general adiposity.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine skeletal muscle cutpoints for identifying elevated physical disability risk in older adults. Subjects included 4,449 older ({\textgreater} or = 60 years) participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988-1994. Physical disability was assessed by questionnaire, and bioimpedance was used to estimate skeletal muscle, which was normalized for height. Receiver operating characteristics were used to develop the skeletal muscle cutpoints associated with a high likelihood of physical disability. Odds for physical disability were compared in subjects whose measures fell above and below these cutpoints. Skeletal muscle cutpoints of 5.76-6.75 and {\textless} or =5.75 kg/m2 were selected to denote moderate and high physical disability risk in women. The corresponding values in men were 8.51-10.75 and {\textless} or =8.50 kg/m2. Compared with women with low-risk skeletal muscle values, women with moderate- and high-risk skeletal muscle values had odds for physical disability of 1.41 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.97, 2.04) and 3.31 (95{\%} CI: 1.91, 5.73), respectively. The corresponding odds in men were 3.65 (95{\%} CI: 1.92, 6.94) and 4.71 (95{\%} CI: 2.28, 9.74). This study presents skeletal muscle cutpoints for physical disability risk in older adults. Future applications of these cutpoints include the comparison of morbidity risk in older persons with normal muscle mass and those with sarcopenia, the determination and comparison of sarcopenia prevalences, and the estimation of health-care costs attributable to sarcopenia.},

abstract = {Depression has been linked to the overall diet using both exploratory and pre-defined methods. However, neither of these methods incorporates specific knowledge on nutrient-disease associations. The aim of the present study was to empirically identify dietary patterns using reduced rank regression and to examine their relations to depressive symptoms. Participants were 2006 Japanese employees aged 19-69 years. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Diet was assessed using a validated, self-administered diet history questionnaire. Dietary patterns were extracted by reduced rank regression with 6 depression-related nutrients as response variables. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of depressive symptoms adjusted for potential confounders. A dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of vegetables, mushrooms, seaweeds, soybean products, green tea, potatoes, fruits, and small fish with bones and a low intake of rice was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios of having depressive symptoms were 0.62 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.48-0.81) in the highest versus lowest tertiles of dietary score. Results suggest that adherence to a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and typical Japanese foods, including mushrooms, seaweeds, soybean products, and green tea, is associated with a lower probability of having depressive symptoms.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to establish adequate criteria for categorizing 'obesity disease' in Japan in relation to obesity-related complications. The subjects were 1,193 Japanese subjects (775 men, 418 women; age: 20-84 years old, body mass index (BMI): 14.9-56.4 kg/m(2)) including subjects undergoing a health examination and obese subjects visiting an obesity clinic. Visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were determined by computed tomography (CT) at the umbilical level. Anthropometric parameters, including BMI, waist circumference (W), waist/hip circumference (W/H), ratio and waist circumference/body height (W/BH) ratio, were measured. Hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension were evaluated as obesity-related complications. The relationship between each parameter and the prevalence of the complications was investigated. The number of complications increased in accordance with BMI and the average value was greater than 1.0 at a BMI of 25. The best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for detecting subjects with multiple risk factors was a BMI of 25. BMI showed a close positive correlation with SFA (r=0.82), even for BMI {\textgreater} or =25 (r=0.77), but had a weaker correlation with VFA (r=0.54). The obese subjects with a BMI {\textgreater} or =25 had no correlation between BMI and VFA because of the wide individual variation of VFA. The number of disorders was greater than 1.0 at 100 cm(2) of VFA and the best combination of the sensitivity and specificity for determining subjects with multiple risk factors was 100 cm(2) of VFA. Between the simple anthropometric values and measurement of VFA, it was proven that W had the closest relationship with VFA in both men (r=0.68) and women (r=0.65). The regression line obtained from simple correlation analyses indicated that the W corresponding to 100 cm(2) of VFA was 84.4 cm in men and 92.5 cm in women. These data suggest that obesity is adequately specified as a BMI {\textgreater} or =25 in Japan where the prevalence and degree of obesity remains mild. It is reasonable to establish the cut-off point of VFA at 100 cm(2) as indicative of the risk of obesity-related disorders and a waist circumference of 85 cm in men and 90 cm in women approximates to this visceral fat mass.},

abstract = {Recent studies have implicated leptin in the modulation of bone mass during skeletal development. Whether leptin also exerts an influence on bone after growth has stopped is unknown at present. In this cross-sectional study on 94 women (60 premenopausal, 34 postmenopausal) aged 40-60 years, we analyzed the relationship between serum leptin and bone density and bone cortex geometry and bone metabolism. Total and trabecular bone density as well as total and cortical bone area were determined by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) at the distal radius. Bone metabolism was assessed by measuring bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide (PICP) and collagen type I C-terminal telopeptide in serum, and deoxypyridinoline in urine samples. None of the indices of bone density or geometry was significantly related to leptin serum concentrations (P {\textgreater} 0.05) before or after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). PICP was associated with serum leptin in the postmenopausal group only (r = -0.40 after adjustment for BMI; P = 0.009). Yet, as none of the other markers of bone metabolism exhibited a significant correlation with serum leptin in any of the menopausal groups, this association is likely to be due to the influence of extraskeletal factors on PICP serum levels. Thus, it appears that leptin has less influence on the mature than on the growing skeleton.},

abstract = {The safety of green tea infusions and green tea extract (GTE)-based products is reviewed regarding catechins. Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the major catechin present in green tea, is suspected of being responsible for liver toxicity reported in humans consuming food supplements. Intake of EGCG with green tea infusions and GTE-based beverages is up to about 450 mg EGCG/person/day in Europe and higher in Asia. Consumption of green tea is not associated with liver damage in humans, and green tea infusion and GTE-based beverages are considered safe in the range of historical uses. In animal studies, EGCG's potency for liver effects is highly dependent on conditions of administration. Use of NOAELs from bolus administration to derive a tolerable upper intake level applying the margin of safety concept results in acceptable EGCG-doses lower than those from one cup of green tea. NOAELs from toxicity studies applying EGCG with diet/split of the daily dose are a better point of departure for risk characterization. In clinical intervention studies, liver effects were not observed after intakes below 600 mg EGCG/person/day. Thus, a tolerable upper intake level of 300 mg EGCG/person/day is proposed for food supplements; this gives a twofold safety margin to clinical studies that did not report liver effects and a margin of safety of 100 to the NOAELs in animal studies with dietary administration of green tea catechins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Evidence on the indirect health impacts of disasters is limited. We assessed the excess mortality risk associated with the indirect health impacts of the 2011 triple disaster (earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster) in Fukushima, Japan. METHODS The mortality rates in Soma and Minamisoma cities in Fukushima from 2006 to 2015 were calculated using vital statistics and resident registrations. We investigated the excess mortality risk, defined as the increased mortality risk between postdisaster and predisaster after excluding direct deaths attributed to the physical force of the disaster. Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of mortality after adjusting for city, age and year. RESULTS There were 6163 and 6125 predisaster and postdisaster deaths, respectively. The postdisaster mortality risk was significantly higher in the first month following the disaster (March 2011) than in the same month during the predisaster period (March 2006-2010). RRs among men and women were 2.64 (95{\%} CI 2.16 to 3.24) and 2.46 (95{\%} CI 1.99 to 3.03), respectively, demonstrating excess mortality risk due to the indirect health effects of the disaster. Age-specific subgroup analyses revealed a significantly higher mortality risk in women aged ≥85 years in the third month of the disaster compared with predisaster baseline, with an RR (95{\%} CI) of 1.73 (1.23 to 2.44). CONCLUSIONS Indirect health impacts are most severe in the first month of the disaster. Early public health support, especially for the elderly, can be an important factor for reducing the indirect health effects of a disaster.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Lung cancer and cardiovascular disease are major causes of death in the United States. It has been proposed that carotenoids and retinoids are agents that may prevent these disorders. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial -- the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial -- involving a total of 18,314 smokers, former smokers, and workers exposed to asbestos. The effects of a combination of 30 mg of beta carotene per day and 25,000 IU of retinol (vitamin A) in the form of retinyl palmitate per day on the primary end point, the incidence of lung cancer, were compared with those of placebo. RESULTS A total of 388 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed during the 73,135 person-years of follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 4.0 years). The active-treatment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.57; P=0.02), as compared with the placebo group. There were no statistically significant differences in the risks of other types of cancer. In the active-treatment group, the relative risk of death from any cause was 1.17 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.33); of death from lung cancer, 1.46 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 2.00); and of death from cardiovascular disease, 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.61). On the basis of these findings, the randomized trial was stopped 21 months earlier than planned; follow-up will continue for another 5 years. CONCLUSIONS After an average of four years of supplementation, the combination of beta carotene and vitamin A had no benefit and may have had an adverse effect on the incidence of lung cancer and on the risk of death from lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and any cause in smokers and workers exposed to asbestos.},

abstract = {Writing about obesity research is a challenging task. While the rising obesity epidemic drastically raised public awareness of the problem, the causes behind the epidemic are still poorly understood. The etiology of obesity is a subject of ongoing scientific debate with widely varying views and strong opinions. Is it mostly genetic or environmental in nature? Is obesity caused by changes in our diet or changes in lifestyle and physical activity or both? Modern research literature quite often offers conflicting findings. Publications in popular media like the one in Time magazine add to the controversy by making quick and strongly worded summaries of academic research. Although the root causes of obesity remains a topic of active research, this review concentrates on the fundamental components of weight regulation in humans and their relative contribution to the energy equation. A better understanding of the energetics of obesity may provide some insight into the etiology of the obesity epidemic. The energetics of obesity also showcases an engineering challenge: development of techniques to accurately measure individual components of the energy equation.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids (GCs) are well known to induce insulin resistance. However, the effect of GCs on insulin secretion has not been well characterized under physiological conditions in human. We here evaluated the effect of GCs on insulin secretion/{\ss}-cell function precisely in a physiological condition. A population-based study of 1,071 Japanese individuals enrolled in the 2014 Iwaki study (390 men, 681 women; aged 54.1 ± 15.1 years), those excluded individuals taking medication for diabetes or steroid treatment, were enrolled in the present study. Association between serum cortisol levels and insulin resistance/secretion assessed by homeostasis model assessment using fasting blood glucose and insulin levels (HOMA-R and HOMA-{\ss}, respectively) were examined. Univariate linear regression analyses showed correlation of serum cortisol levels with HOMA-{\ss} ({\ss} = -0.134, p {\textless}0.001) but not with HOMA-R ({\ss} = 0.042, p = 0.172). Adjustments for age, gender, and the multiple clinical characteristics correlated with HOMA indices showed similar results (HOMA-{\ss}: {\ss} = -0.062, p = 0.025; HOMA-R: {\ss} = -0.023, p = 0.394). The correlation between serum cortisol levels and HOMA-{\ss} remained significant after adjustment for HOMA- R ({\ss} = -0.057, p = 0.034). When subjects were tertiled based on serum cortisol levels, the highest tertile was at greater risk of decreased insulin secretion (defined as lower one third of HOMA-{\ss} (≤70)) than the lowest tertile, after adjustment for multiple factors including HOMA- R (odds ratio 1.26, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.03-1.54). In conclusion, higher serum cortisol levels are significantly associated with decreased insulin secretion in the physiological cortisol range in a Japanese population.},

abstract = {Prolactin (PRL) has roles in various physiological functions. Although experimental stud- ies showed that PRL has both beneficial and adverse effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinical findings in subjects with hyperprolactinemia indicate adverse effects on glucose metabolism. However, effects of PRL within the physiological range in human are contro- versial. A population-based study of 370 Japanese men enrolled in the 2014 Iwaki study (aged 52.0 ± 14.8 years). In this cross-sectional study, associations between serum PRL levels and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) indices representing glucose metab- olism in a physiological setting were examined using multivariable regression analysis. Although univariate linear regression analyses showed significant associations between serum PRL levels and HOMA indices, adjustment with multiple factors made the associa- tion with HOMA-{\ss} (insulin secretion) insignificant, while those with HOMA-R (insulin resistance) remained significant ({\ss} = 0.084, p = 0.035). Non-linear regression analyses showed a regression curve with a peak at serum PRL level, 12.4 ng/mL and a positive association of serum PRL level with HOMA-R below the peak ({\ss} = 0.119, p = 0.004). Higher serum PRL levels within the physiological range seem to be associated with insulin resistance in men. Introduction},

abstract = {Molecular epidemiological studies can provide novel insights into the transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Typically, risk factors for transmission are identified using traditional hypothesis-driven statistical methods such as logistic regression. However, limitations become apparent in these approaches as the scope of these studies expand to include additional epidemiological and bacterial genomic data. Here we examine the use of Bayesian models to analyze tuberculosis epidemiology. We begin by exploring the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) to identify the distribution of tuberculosis patient attributes (including demographic and clinical attributes). Using existing algorithms for constructing BNs from observational data, we learned a BN from data about tuberculosis patients collected in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999. We verified that the resulting probabilistic models did in fact capture known statistical relationships. Next, we examine the use of newly introduced methods for representing and automatically constructing probabilistic models in structured domains. We use statistical relational models (SRMs) to model distributions over relational domains. SRMs are ideally suited to richly structured epidemiological data. We use a data-driven method to construct a statistical relational model directly from data stored in a relational database. The resulting model reveals the relationships between variables in the data and describes their distribution. We applied this procedure to the data on tuberculosis patients in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999, their Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and data on contact investigations. The resulting statistical relational model corroborated previously reported findings and revealed several novel associations. These models illustrate the potential for this approach to reveal relationships within richly structured data that may not be apparent using conventional statistical approaches. We show that Bayesian methods, in particular statistical relational models, are an important tool for understanding infectious disease epidemiology. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The sample variances and covariances, and possibly the means, are compared to those predicted by a theory-based hypothetical model after optimal estimation of the parameters of the model. The goodness-of-fit of the empirical data to the hypothesized model is evaluated statistically. This review describes the underlying statistical theory and rationale of SEM. Both confirmatory factor analysis and latent variable path models are discussed. The applicability of SEM to assessment of reliability and validity is noted. A detailed example is provided, and several examples from the medical literature are briefly reviewed. Cautions regarding the possible misuse or misinterpretation of the technique are also mentioned. Possible future directions for the use of SEM in medical research are suggested. Two appendices provide more technical details.},

METHODS Using total nutrient intake (from foods and supplements) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2008, we determined usual intakes for micronutrients using the National Cancer Institute methodology in adults (n = 18,177). Only subjects with reliable dietary records were included and pregnant and lactating females were excluded. Subjects were categorized by body weight status as either normal weight (body mass index [BMI] {\textless} 25), overweight (BMI ≥ 25 to {\textless} 30), or obese (BMI ≥ 30). RESULTS A substantial proportion of the adult population (over 40{\%}) had inadequate intakes of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, calcium, and magnesium. Compared to normal weight adults, obese adults had about 5{\%} to 12{\%} lower (p {\textless} 0.05) intakes of micronutrients and higher (p {\textless} 0.01) prevalence of nutrient inadequacy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The possible advantage for weight loss of a diet that emphasizes protein, fat, or carbohydrates has not been established, and there are few studies that extend beyond 1 year. METHODS We randomly assigned 811 overweight adults to one of four diets; the targeted percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65{\%}; 20, 25, and 55{\%}; 40, 15, and 45{\%}; and 40, 25, and 35{\%}. The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health. The participants were offered group and individual instructional sessions for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 years in two-by-two factorial comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content. RESULTS At 6 months, participants assigned to each diet had lost an average of 6 kg, which represented 7{\%} of their initial weight; they began to regain weight after 12 months. By 2 years, weight loss remained similar in those who were assigned to a diet with 15{\%} protein and those assigned to a diet with 25{\%} protein (3.0 and 3.6 kg, respectively); in those assigned to a diet with 20{\%} fat and those assigned to a diet with 40{\%} fat (3.3 kg for both groups); and in those assigned to a diet with 65{\%} carbohydrates and those assigned to a diet with 35{\%} carbohydrates (2.9 and 3.4 kg, respectively) (P{\textgreater}0.20 for all comparisons). Among the 80{\%} of participants who completed the trial, the average weight loss was 4 kg; 14 to 15{\%} of the participants had a reduction of at least 10{\%} of their initial body weight. Satiety, hunger, satisfaction with the diet, and attendance at group sessions were similar for all diets; attendance was strongly associated with weight loss (0.2 kg per session attended). The diets improved lipid-related risk factors and fasting insulin levels. CONCLUSIONS Reduced-calorie diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00072995.)},

Given that environmental factors such as dietary habits may play a major role in the causation of prostate cancer and the high consumption of green tea in Asian populations, this low incidence may be partly due to the effects of green tea. The JPHC Study (Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study) was established in 1990 for cohort I and in 1993 for cohort II. The subjects were 49,920 men aged 40-69 years who completed a questionnaire that included their green tea consumption habit at baseline and were followed until the end of 2004. During this time, 404 men were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, of whom 114 had advanced cases, 271 were localized, and 19 were of an undetermined stage. Green tea was not associated with localized prostate cancer. However, consumption was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in the risk of advanced prostate cancer. The multivariate relative risk was 0.52 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.28, 0.96) for men drinking 5 or more cups/day compared with less than 1 cup/day (p(trend) = 0.01).

Although there are a number of candidate antiobesity drugs, only a few of them have been proven able to inhibit appetite for palatable foods without the concurrent reduction in regular food consumption. In this review, we discuss the interrelationships between homeostatic and hedonic food intake control mechanisms in promoting overeating with palatable foods and assess the potential usefulness of systemically administered pharmaceuticals that impinge on the endogenous cannabinoid, opioid, aminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic systems in the modification of food preference behavior. Also, certain dietary supplements with the potency to reduce specifically palatable food intake are presented. Based on human and animal studies, we indicate the most promising therapies and agents that influence the effectiveness of appetite-modifying drugs. It should be stressed, however, that most of the data included in our review come from preclinical studies; therefore, further investigations aimed at confirming the effectiveness and safety of the aforementioned medications in the treatment of obese humans are necessary.},

abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), often concomitant with obesity, increases the risk for the metabolic syndrome. One mechanism that may participate in this association is upregulation of inflammatory pathways. We used structural equation modeling to assess the interrelations between childhood obesity, OSA, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. One hundred and eighty-four children (127 boys, mean age: 8.5 +/- 4.1 years) had height and weight measured, underwent overnight polysomnography and had fasting blood taken. The blood was analyzed for insulin, glucose, lipids, leptin, and cytokines [interferon (IFN)-gamma, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha]. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate associations between the outcomes of interest including hypoxia, arousal (related to respiratory and spontaneous), obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammatory markers. Two cytokine factors and one metabolic factor were derived for the SEM. These factors provided good fit in the structural equation model (chi(2)/df = 2.855; comparative fit index = 0.90, root mean squared error of approximation = 0.10) and all factor loadings were significantly different from zero (P {\textless} or = 0.01). Overall, our results indicate that while obesity (as measured by body mass index z-score) has a major influence on the metabolic dysfunction associated with OSA, arousal indices, and cytokine markers may also influence this association. Our results support the hypothesis that OSA is a contributor to the mechanisms that link sleep, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, and show that the interrelations may begin in childhood.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of a single oral ingestion of alpha-linolenic  acid-enriched diacylglycerol (ALA-DAG) on postprandial serum triglyceride (TG) levels. A randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover study was performed in subjects with normal or moderately high fasting serum TG levels. Subjects ingested 0.00 g [control: triacylglycerol; TAG (rapeseed oil)], 1.25 g (1.25-g: mixture of 1.25 g ALA-DAG and 1.25 g TAG), or 2.50 g (2.50 g) of ALA-DAG in random order with a 6-d washout period. Serum TG levels were evaluated in the fasting state, and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after the test meal. Thirty-eight subjects completed the study and were defined as the per protocol set. As the primary outcome, postprandial serum TG levels were significantly lower in the 2.50-g treatment compared with the control. The TG level did not differ significantly between the 1.25-g and control. The suppressive effect of ALA-DAG on the serum TG level correlated significantly with the body mass index and fasting insulin level. ALA-DAG at a dose of 2.50 g had greater effects on serum TG and apolipoprotein B levels in subjects with a higher body mass index ({\textgreater}/=25 kg/m2) and higher fasting serum insulin levels ({\textgreater}10 muU/mL). Our findings suggest that ingesting 2.50 g ALA-DAG suppresses the postprandial serum TG level in people with normal and moderately high fasting serum TG levels, presumably as a result of poor re-esterification of dietary fat into TG in the intestinal mucosa.},

abstract = {Although abdominal obesity or visceral obesity is considered to be one of the components of metabolic syndrome and to have an important role in a cluster of cardiovascular risks, there is no consensus about the definition and diagnostic criteria for this syndrome, probably because there is considerable disagreement about the location and definition of abdominal obesity or visceral obesity.In this review article, the important role of visceral fat accumulation in the development of a variety of lifestyle-related diseases is shown, including cardiovascular disease based on our clinical studies using CT scans, and the mechanism of these disorders is discussed, focusing on adipocytokines, especially adiponectin.The importance of diagnosing metabolic syndrome, in which visceral fat accumulation plays an essential role in the development of multiple risk factors, should be emphasized because lifestyle modification for the reduction of visceral fat may be very effective for the reduction of risks of this type, namely metabolic syndrome in the narrow sense.},
